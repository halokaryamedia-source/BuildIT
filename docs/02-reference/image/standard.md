# LazyDesigner Unified Image Reference Standard

Updated: 2026-09-11

This document owns the canonical **visual-sheet composition** for ChatGPT-generated LazyDesigner reference images.

It does not own scale semantics (`scale-and-escalation.md`) or generation prompt construction (`prompt-contract.md`).

## Core Principle

```text
EVERY VISIBLE PANEL MUST REDUCE DOWNSTREAM UNCERTAINTY
```

A panel exists only when it materially helps one or more of:

```text
GEOMETRY_AMBIGUITY
TEXTURE_AMBIGUITY
ANIMATION_AMBIGUITY
```

Decorative, redundant, already-obvious, or decision-neutral panels are removed.

## One Unified Visual System

All profiles use the same visual grammar:

```text
PROP_FURNITURE
VEHICLE
HUMANOID
CREATURE
MECHANICAL
PLANT_FOLIAGE
GENERIC
```

Content adapts by asset; the reference-sheet language does not split into separate template systems.

## Default

```text
1 PRIMARY REFERENCE SHEET PER ASSET
```

Sheet 01 carries the maximum useful non-crowded evidence.

```text
Sheet 01 = canonical identity + scale impression + core construction
Sheet 02+ = bounded elaboration / overflow only
```

Additional sheets never redesign or rescale the asset.

## Information Priority

When space is constrained:

```text
GEOMETRY > TEXTURE > ANIMATION
```

This is a space/readability priority, not a statement that downstream stages are less important.

Never shrink critical form/proportion/depth evidence merely to fit lower-value support content.

## Information Budget

Default upper guidance for one sheet:

```text
HERO                 1
CONSTRUCTION VIEWS   2–4
CRITICAL DETAILS     0–3
KEY POSES            0–5
```

These are not quotas. Simple assets may use far less.

## Panel Priority

```text
P1 — REQUIRED
Without it, Astra/Codex may materially misread the asset.

P2 — USEFUL
Improves accuracy but is not essential.

P3 — REDUNDANT / DECORATIVE
Does not materially change a downstream decision.
```

Use:

```text
include P1
include P2 while readability remains strong
remove P3
```

If crowded, remove the lowest-value P2 before shrinking P1.

## Universal Layout Grammar

Preferred adaptive composition:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ASSET NAME                                           │
├──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┤
│                          │ FRONT                     │
│       HERO / 3/4         │ LEFT                      │
│                          │ BACK / TOP / RIGHT        │
│                          │ only when useful          │
├──────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┤
│ CRITICAL DETAIL 1 │ DETAIL 2 │ DETAIL 3             │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ KEY POSES / MOTION STRIP — only when useful         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```text
no animation       → no motion row
no critical detail → no detail row
no useful BACK/TOP → enlarge useful views
simple asset       → fewer/larger panels
complex overflow   → additional sheet instead of overpacking
```

```text
CONTENT DECIDES LAYOUT
NOT LAYOUT FORCES CONTENT
```

## Header

Required:

```text
ASSET NAME
```

Optional small subtitle only when it materially helps orientation.

Do not add quotes, slogans, model-info paragraphs, or technical prose inside the image.

## Hero View

Use one dominant hero when it improves whole-form understanding.

Preferred default:

```text
FRONT-LEFT 3/4
```

Hero communicates:

```text
identity
whole silhouette
volume/depth
major layering
primary attachment relationships
major material separation
```

It is a production reference, not a cinematic beauty render.

## Construction Views

Use minimum sufficient views.

```text
FRONT → width / height / visible part count / primary silhouette
LEFT  → depth / profile / attachment / body axis
BACK  → only when rear topology/asymmetry matters
TOP   → only when footprint/depth/layout matters
RIGHT → only when left/right asymmetry matters
```

Do not require all sides ceremonially.

Orthographic/construction views preserve consistent orientation, apparent scale, and proportions.

## Critical Detail Panels

Create a detail panel only when a high-risk relationship is not already clear.

Typical useful examples:

```text
PROP_FURNITURE → shelf angle, drawer/door relation, support joint
VEHICLE        → wheel mounting, cockpit opening, hinge/axle
HUMANOID       → hand/tool attachment, backpack attachment, shoulder/hip overlap
CREATURE       → wing root, jaw, tail base
MECHANICAL     → linkage, slider/guide, pivot/axis relation
PLANT_FOLIAGE  → stem/branch or carrier relationship when ambiguous
```

No decorative close-ups.

## Texture Evidence

Do not reserve a mandatory texture panel.

Prefer material/color/marking evidence to remain readable in hero, construction, and detail panels.

Add dedicated material evidence only when needed for:

```text
identity-critical marking
emissive region
alpha/cutout silhouette
important asymmetric material
directional pattern/surface
source-specific material distinction
```

Do not add palette boxes by default.

## Motion Evidence

Include only when animation is required and pose evidence materially helps.

Common action pattern:

```text
READY
ANTICIPATION
ACTION / CONTACT
FOLLOW_THROUGH
RECOVERY
```

Simpler motion may use:

```text
START
EXTREME
RETURN
```

The image owns pose silhouette, direction, and contact. Detailed timing belongs in `ANIMATION.md`.

If poses become unreadable, move them to Sheet 02 rather than shrinking Geometry evidence.

## Multi-Sheet Escalation

Detailed escalation thresholds are owned by `scale-and-escalation.md`.

Semantic naming examples:

```text
01-main-reference.png
02-detail-rig.png
02-motion-reference.png
02-mechanical-detail.png
03-variants.png        ← only when required
```

Every added sheet has one bounded purpose.

## Identity + Scale Lock / Anti-Drift

Once Sheet 01 establishes approved authority, later sheets preserve:

```text
same asset identity
same player/world scale relationship
same whole-model proportions
same required part count
same major silhouette
same approved materials/colors
same accessories/props
same asymmetry/orientation
same construction logic
```

A later sheet may reveal more detail but may not redesign or rescale existing authority.

A user-approved material change to any locked element is a revision and must update affected evidence coherently.

## Repeated View Consistency

When a view repeats across sheets, preserve:

```text
orientation
subject proportions
apparent underlying scale
visible part identity
material identity
camera convention
```

An enlarged detail panel may change presentation size without changing underlying asset proportion/scale.

## Visual Language

```text
clean light/neutral background
neutral studio-like lighting
clear Minecraft/Blockbench target construction
readable voxel/block form
high edge/silhouette clarity
low visual noise
consistent scale within related views
minimal decorative styling
```

Do not use cinematic environments for construction evidence.

Small contextual hero presentation is acceptable only when context materially helps function/attachment understanding.

## Minecraft Target Only

When starting from real-world/non-Minecraft evidence:

```text
source image = evidence
final production sheet = approved Minecraft/Blockbench interpretation
```

Do not place the real source inside the final production sheet merely for comparison. It may remain separately packaged as `SOURCE_REFERENCE` when needed.

## Text Policy

Image text is limited to:

```text
asset title
view labels
short panel labels
short pose labels
```

No paragraphs, JSON-like annotations, implementation instructions, or long technical notes.

## Default Removals

Do not include by default:

```text
color palette box
generic model-info block
decorative quote/tagline
scale illustration unless decision-critical
RIGHT when identical to LEFT
TOP when it constrains nothing
repeated props already clear
close-up already clear
long explanatory text
real-image comparison panel
```

## Internal Visual QA

Before user review verify:

```text
identity matches confirmed brief
player/world scale matches current Scale Lock
required parts are present
hero and construction views agree
proportions do not drift
attachments/openings agree
approved materials/colors remain stable
support panels describe the same asset
motion poses preserve geometry identity + scale
labels are minimal/correct
no panel is redundant
critical evidence remains large enough to interpret
```

For Sheet 02+, compare directly against Sheet 01 identity and scale locks.

## Failure Rules

A sheet fails on any material condition:

```text
cross-view structural contradiction
part shape/count changes without approved reason
player/world scale drifts across views/sheets
material identity drifts
later sheet redesigns or rescales asset
critical view becomes unreadably small
panel density reduces usefulness
motion compensates for incorrect Geometry
visual decoration displaces decision-critical evidence
```

Fix the owning issue before approval.

## Completion

A visual reference set is efficient when:

```text
every panel has a decision purpose
one primary sheet carries maximum useful non-crowded evidence
additional sheets exist only for real overflow
all sheets remain identity-locked + scale-locked
Geometry/Texture/Animation evidence appears only where useful
Astra/Codex can interpret the asset without redundant presentation content
```
