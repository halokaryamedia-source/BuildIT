# LazyDesigner Image Generation Prompt Contract

Updated: 2026-09-11

This document owns the internal prompt structure used by ChatGPT Reference Preparation for generated reference images. It converts already-confirmed decisions into a compact generation instruction; it does not replace user authority, the Prompt Compiler, or the Unified Image Reference Standard.

## Core Principle

```text
CONFIRMED USER INTENT
+ CLEAN COMPILED BRIEF
+ SHEET PURPOSE
+ PANEL PLAN
+ IDENTITY LOCK
+ SCALE LOCK when material
→ GENERATION PROMPT
```

Never generate directly from the uncontrolled conversation when a compiled brief exists.

## Inputs

Use only the minimum relevant subset of:

```text
confirmed asset identity
selected profile
approved Minecraft/Blockbench target
explicit dimensions when relevant
player-relative scale anchor when relevant
required semantic parts
required materials/colors/markings
required asymmetry/orientation
required attachments/openings
required articulation/action
current sheet purpose
selected panel plan
approved prior-sheet identity + scale locks
source evidence when needed
```

Do not include rejected alternatives, unrelated discussion, system-development context, or MCP implementation instructions.

## Prompt Layers

Build prompts in this order:

```text
1. TARGET IDENTITY
2. VISUAL STYLE / RENDER LANGUAGE
3. IDENTITY LOCK
4. SCALE LOCK when material
5. SHEET PURPOSE
6. PANEL PLAN
7. PANEL-SPECIFIC EVIDENCE
8. CONSISTENCY RULES
9. NEGATIVE / DO-NOT-CHANGE RULES
10. PRESENTATION RULES
```

Identity and scale are established before local panel instructions.

## 1. Target Identity

One concise sentence.

```text
Create a Minecraft Bedrock / Blockbench reference sheet for a stylized fisherman NPC with a small bench, bucket and fishing rod.
```

Do not add unconfirmed lore, environment, accessories, or realism.

## 2. Visual Style / Render Language

```text
Minecraft/Blockbench target only
clean voxel/block construction
neutral studio-like lighting
light neutral background
high silhouette and edge clarity
readable material separation
consistent proportions across panels
minimal decorative styling
```

Do not embed the original real-world source into the final production sheet by default.

## 3. Identity Lock

Sheet 01 builds the lock from the confirmed brief and approved target evidence.

Sheet 02+ preserves:

```text
same asset identity
same required part count
same major silhouette
same materials/colors
same accessories/props
same asymmetry/orientation
same construction logic
same identity-critical markings
```

A user-approved change to a locked element is a revision; rebuild affected locks before generating dependent sheets.

## 4. Scale Lock

Include when scale materially affects world readability, interaction, occupancy, or proportion.

Use either/both:

```text
explicit dimensions_blocks
player_relative_scale
```

Rules:
- numeric dimensions remain numeric authority;
- player-relative scale preserves world/interaction relationship;
- never convert a relative category into invented block dimensions;
- Sheet 02+ preserves Sheet 01 apparent player/world scale and major-part proportions;
- detail panels may be enlarged for readability without implying a different underlying asset scale.

## 5. Sheet Purpose

One primary reason per sheet:

```text
MAIN_REFERENCE
DETAIL_REFERENCE
MOTION_REFERENCE
VARIANT_REFERENCE
```

`MAIN_REFERENCE` is default. Additional sheets exist only for real information/readability pressure.

## 6. Panel Plan

Use the Unified Image Reference Standard.

Default upper guidance:

```text
HERO                 1
CONSTRUCTION VIEWS   2–4
CRITICAL DETAILS     0–3
KEY POSES            0–5
```

Each included panel has:

```text
panel id
type
view / subject
purpose
priority: P1 | P2
```

A panel without downstream purpose is removed before generation.

## 7. Panel-Specific Evidence

### HERO

```text
whole identity
silhouette
volume/depth
major layering
primary attachment relationships
material separation
```

### CONSTRUCTION

```text
FRONT → width/height/part count/front identity
LEFT  → depth/profile/attachment/body axis
BACK  → rear topology/asymmetry when needed
TOP   → footprint/depth/layout when needed
RIGHT → asymmetry only when needed
```

### DETAIL

Only high-risk relationships not already clear in main views.

### KEY_POSE

Pose silhouette, action direction, contact, and articulation only. Do not encode final exact keyframe values in pixels.

## 8. Consistency Rules

Every prompt requires:

```text
same identity across panels
same apparent player/world scale across panels
same proportions across panels
same part count
same accessories
same approved materials/colors
same left/right orientation
same structural attachment logic
same voxel/detail language
```

Orthographic panels are views of one asset, not independently redesigned illustrations.

## 9. Negative / Do-Not-Change Rules

Use only likely current failure modes.

Common examples:

```text
no cropped subject
no extra/missing major parts
no cross-view proportion or scale drift
no mirrored asymmetry unless required
no floating attachments
no invented accessories
no real-image comparison panel
no decorative scene obscuring construction
no long explanatory text
no unnecessary palette/scale panel
no redundant view
```

Add asset-specific negatives only where they prevent a known high-risk error.

## 10. Presentation Rules

Adaptive composition:

```text
HEADER
HERO + CONSTRUCTION VIEWS
CRITICAL DETAILS when needed
MOTION STRIP when needed
```

Image text is limited to asset title, view labels, short detail labels, and short pose labels.

Remove unused rows and enlarge remaining evidence. If useful evidence becomes too small, escalate to Sheet 02+ rather than overpacking.

## Generation Modes

### Sheet 01 — Main Reference

```text
TARGET IDENTITY
+ VISUAL LANGUAGE
+ IDENTITY LOCK
+ SCALE LOCK when material
+ MAIN_REFERENCE purpose
+ minimum useful panel plan
+ consistency rules
+ targeted negatives
+ adaptive layout
```

### Sheet 02+ — Continuation

```text
APPROVED SHEET 01 AS VISUAL ANCHOR
+ exact same identity lock
+ exact same scale lock
+ one overflow purpose
+ only new required panels
+ explicit DO NOT REDESIGN / DO NOT RESCALE
+ repeated-view consistency
```

Do not regenerate later sheets from prose alone when approved Sheet 01 is available.

### Correction / Revision

```text
APPROVED CURRENT VISUAL
+ CHANGE
+ PRESERVE
+ affected panels
```

Use bounded editing when possible. A scale or identity change is a revision; propagate it coherently to every materially affected view.

## Source-Image Translation

```text
source image = evidence
compiled target = Minecraft interpretation decision
final production sheet = Minecraft/Blockbench target only
```

Preserve source-supported identity while simplifying to a buildable Minecraft visual language.

## Profile Influence

Profiles help identify high-value evidence but do not change the universal prompt structure. Include only profile conclusions relevant to planned panels; never dump the whole profile into the prompt.

## Pre-Generation Check

```text
blocking requirements resolved
compiled brief current
final confirmation approved
scale resolved enough for this artifact
sheet purpose justified
panel plan readable
all panels P1/P2
identity lock explicit
scale lock explicit when material
no superseded instruction remains
no invented design fact added
```

If any check fails, do not generate.

## Post-Generation Check

```text
identity correct
player/world scale correct
part count correct
cross-view proportions consistent
attachments/openings consistent
materials/colors consistent
asymmetry preserved
critical details useful
motion poses preserve model identity + scale
labels minimal/correct
no redundant/decorative panel displaced useful evidence
```

For Sheet 02+, compare directly against Sheet 01.

## Economy Rule

Use the shortest prompt that reliably preserves all decision-critical authority.

Prefer structured clauses, panel-specific facts, identity/scale locks, and a small targeted negative list. Avoid conversation transcript, repeated profile prose, generic art-direction paragraphs, implementation instructions, and duplicate facts.

## Completion

The prompting layer is correct when raw conversation no longer contaminates generation, scale and identity remain stable across sheets, panel selection stays decision-driven, corrections remain bounded, and the generator receives enough structure without unnecessary context.
