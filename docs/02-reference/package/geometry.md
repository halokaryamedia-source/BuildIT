# LazyDesigner GEOMETRY.md Contract

Updated: 2026-09-11

This document owns the canonical content and structure of `GEOMETRY.md` inside a ChatGPT-generated LazyDesigner reference package.

`GEOMETRY.md` is a **stage-specific projection** for Codex/Astra. It explains only Geometry consequences already supported by the approved user intent, approved visual references, and `REFERENCE.json`. It is not an independent authority and not a Cube-by-Cube blueprint.

## Objective

`GEOMETRY.md` should let Codex answer quickly:

```text
what must be built?
what world/player scale must it preserve?
what numeric envelope is authoritative when known?
what major parts and relationships matter?
what silhouette/depth/openings must be preserved?
what representation is appropriate?
what hierarchy/pivot/rig-readiness constraints already matter?
which images should be inspected for Geometry?
what is still unknown or blocking?
```

## Authority

```text
1. explicit current user requirement
2. approved visual reference
3. confirmed numeric / player-relative scale requirement
4. REFERENCE.json structured facts
5. GEOMETRY.md explanatory projection
6. downstream Codex interpretation
```

`GEOMETRY.md` must never introduce a fact absent from stronger authority.

## Canonical Section Order

Use only applicable sections, preserving this order for predictable scanning:

```text
# Geometry Reference

## Target
## Scale
## Primary Structure
## Proportion & Silhouette
## Attachment / Contact / Openings
## Representation Guidance
## Rig Readiness            ← only when materially relevant
## Geometry Constraints
## Visual References
## Unknowns / Blockers
```

Simple assets may omit sections with no material content.

## 1. Target

Required. One concise sentence describing the asset being built.

```markdown
## Target
Minecraft Bedrock farmer NPC carrying a back basket and using the approved harvesting tool.
```

Do not paste conversation history or compiled prompts.

## 2. Scale

Include whenever world/player scale or numeric envelope materially affects construction.

Use scale facts from `REFERENCE.json` without inventing conversion values.

Player-relative example:

```markdown
## Scale
- Player-relative: `PLAYER_HEIGHT`
- Numeric dimensions: unspecified
```

Numeric + relative example:

```markdown
## Scale
- Player-relative: `RIDEABLE_1P`
- Width: 1.5 Minecraft blocks
- Height: 1.8 Minecraft blocks
- Length: 2.4 Minecraft blocks
```

Rules:
- explicit numeric dimensions are numeric authority;
- player-relative scale communicates world/interactivity relationship;
- never infer exact block dimensions from image pixels or a relative category;
- never silently replace explicit dimensions with visually convenient values;
- `unspecified` means no numeric fact was confirmed;
- if numeric and player-relative scale materially conflict, mark the dependent Geometry decision `BLOCKED` rather than reconciling silently;
- do not invent per-part dimensions unless explicitly confirmed and materially required.

## 3. Primary Structure

List only decision-critical semantic assemblies, preferably using the same stable IDs as `REFERENCE.json`.

Example:

```markdown
## Primary Structure
- head
- torso
- pelvis
- left/right upper arms
- left/right lower arms
- hands
- left/right upper legs
- left/right lower legs
- feet
- straw hat
- back basket
- harvesting tool
```

Rules:
- semantic part identity, not Cube inventory;
- omit decorative micro-parts that do not affect form or later correction;
- preserve asymmetry explicitly.

## 4. Proportion & Silhouette

Describe only Geometry relationships that materially affect recognition.

Good content includes:

```text
whole-body/body-to-part ratios
major width/height/depth relationships
stance / body axis
wheelbase / occupancy / ground clearance when relevant
major taper / slope / curvature direction
identity-critical silhouette landmarks
```

Example:

```markdown
## Proportion & Silhouette
- Preserve the approved head-to-body ratio.
- Hat brim remains wider than the head and is a major silhouette landmark.
- Basket remains a distinct rear mass in side and 3/4 views.
```

Do not add aesthetic prose that cannot change Geometry.

## 5. Attachment / Contact / Openings

Describe topology and negative-space requirements.

```markdown
## Attachment / Contact / Openings
- Hat attaches to `head`.
- Basket attaches to the upper-back/torso region and must not float behind the body.
- Harvesting tool is owned by `right_hand`.
- Preserve the reference-visible gap between arm and basket.
```

Use for:
- parent/contact relationships;
- ground/support contact;
- intended open cavities;
- boundaries that must remain visually closed;
- articulation overlap/contact requirements;
- orientation that changes construction.

Do not invent hidden supports or internal structure.

## 6. Representation Guidance

Record only representation decisions that materially reduce ambiguity.

Allowed vocabulary:

```text
VOLUMETRIC_GEOMETRY
SEGMENTED_FORM
PLANE_LIKE
CROSSED_CUTOUT
LAYERED_CUTOUT
TEXTURE_ONLY
ANIMATION_ONLY
OMIT
UNRESOLVED
```

Example:

```markdown
## Representation Guidance
- Body, hat, basket and tool: `VOLUMETRIC_GEOMETRY`.
- Flat shirt markings: `TEXTURE_ONLY`.
- Thin basket strap: simplest supported representation; exact implementation remains a Codex decision.
```

Rules:
- guidance is a constraint/hint, not an implementation recipe;
- no fixed Cube count, exact coordinates, mandatory primitive count, or exact plane angle;
- insufficient evidence stays `UNRESOLVED`.

## 7. Rig Readiness

Include only when animation or articulation materially affects Geometry.

```markdown
## Rig Readiness
- Upper legs overlap the pelvis enough to avoid exposed hip gaps during intended swing.
- Shoulder attachment remains visually closed through expected arm range.
- Harvesting tool remains a separable motion participant owned by the right hand.
```

May describe:

```text
participating semantic parts
parent-child relationship
pivot region
axis intent
overlap / coverage
clearance
attachment invariants
deformation risk
```

Do not provide exact pivot coordinates or animation keys.

## 8. Geometry Constraints

Keep only stable asset-specific correctness constraints not already expressed more clearly elsewhere.

```markdown
## Geometry Constraints
- Use the user-supplied harvesting tool; do not substitute a generic pickaxe.
- Preserve basket silhouette and attachment.
- Do not close reference-visible negative spaces with convenience geometry.
```

Do not repeat generic Modelling Skill rules.

## 9. Visual References

Required when packaged images materially constrain Geometry.

Refer to stable image IDs from `REFERENCE.json`.

```markdown
## Visual References
- `IMG_GEO_01` — primary whole-form authority.
- `IMG_GEO_02` — basket attachment detail.
- `IMG_RIG_01` — joint overlap / rig-readiness evidence only.
```

State why each image matters; do not redescribe every visible detail.

## 10. Unknowns / Blockers

Include whenever Geometry-relevant uncertainty remains.

```markdown
## Unknowns / Blockers

### Blocking
- None.

### Non-blocking
- Exact underside basket color is unresolved and does not affect Geometry.
```

Only Geometry-stage blockers belong here. A Texture-only unknown must not block Geometry.

## Profile Use

`GEOMETRY.md` may contain conclusions derived from one selected primary profile, but must not copy the profile itself.

```text
profile knowledge
→ asset-specific conclusion only
```

## Concision Rule

Prefer:

```text
stable semantic bullets
explicit relationships
short constraints
image-ID references
```

Avoid long prose, revision history, generic tutorials, implementation speculation, or repeated prompt wording.

## Never Include

```text
guessed Cube coordinates
fixed Cube counts
unverified part dimensions
exact UV islands
texture painting instructions
animation implementation keys
Tool-call sequences
MCP schemas
Blockbench API documentation
unsupported hidden geometry
conversation transcript
compiled-prompt history
```

## Adaptive Size

Simple asset:

```text
Target
Scale
Primary Structure
Representation Guidance
Visual References
Unknowns
```

Complex articulated asset may use the full canonical section set.

Do not inflate trivial assets into long documents.

## Correction Rule

A bounded user correction updates only affected Geometry guidance, image refs, blockers, and scale/proportion facts when applicable. Preserve unaffected accepted guidance.

## Completion

`GEOMETRY.md` is ready when:

```text
it agrees with REFERENCE.json and approved images
scale/world relationship is explicit enough for the next Geometry decision
numeric and player-relative scale do not conflict
Geometry-relevant parts/relationships are clear
representation ambiguity is reduced where evidence allows
articulation constraints appear only when needed
visual references are mapped by stable image ID
Geometry blockers are explicit
no Texture/Animation implementation detail leaked in
```
