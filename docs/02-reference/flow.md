# LazyDesigner ChatGPT Reference Flow

Updated: 2026-09-12

This document owns the ChatGPT-side operational sequence before an asset reference is handed downstream. Durable policy lives in `policy.md`; image construction lives under `image/`; particle/VFX reference authoring lives under `particle/`; compact Codex package structure and consumption live under `package/`.

## Objective

Convert incomplete or casual user intent into an internally clean reference target without requiring the user to understand prompting, topology, UV, rigging, particle JSON, or package terminology.

## Canonical User Flow

```text
USER REQUEST
→ UNDERSTAND
→ REQUIREMENT GATE
→ missing BLOCKING information?
   ├─ YES → ASK SIMPLE QUESTIONS → USER ANSWERS → GATE AGAIN
   └─ NO
→ PROMPT COMPILER
→ CLEAN PRODUCTION BRIEF
→ CLASSIFY REQUIRED REFERENCE CAPABILITY
   ├─ visual/model only
   │  → FINAL CONFIRMATION when the target materially depends on user decisions
   │  → image/
   ├─ particle/VFX only
   │  → particle/authoring-spec.md
   │  → no ceremonial pre-confirmation when no BLOCKING ambiguity remains
   │  → particle first-pass authoring
   └─ both
      → use each branch only for the dependency it actually owns
→ BRANCH-SPECIFIC INTERNAL QA
→ USER REVIEW / CORRECTION when material
→ PACKAGE ONLY WHEN EXPLICITLY REQUESTED OR UNAMBIGUOUSLY PART OF THE REQUEST
→ CONSISTENCY GATE when packaging/handoff exists
→ DOWNSTREAM USE / CODEX / MCP when requested
```

## 1. Understand

Resolve only what is supported by current intent/evidence:

```text
asset/effect identity
required capability: visual/model, particle/VFX, or both
task: new / continuation / correction
source/reference authority
scale or viewing distance when known
animation or motion requirement
critical parts/actions/materials/style
still-valid approved prior decisions
```

Do not invent missing facts.

## 2. Requirement Gate

Classify missing information:

```text
BLOCKING
USEFUL
OPTIONAL
```

`BLOCKING` must be resolved when the answer can materially change identity, primary structure, scale/viewing distance, required articulation/motion, or another major output decision.

`USEFUL` is asked only when it is likely to materially improve correctness. `OPTIONAL` does not block a first pass.

For visual/model references, scale follows `image/scale-and-escalation.md`. For particle/VFX tasks, intent normalization and reversible provisional choices follow `particle/authoring-spec.md`.

## 3. Independent Capability Rule

Reference branches are optional and independent.

```text
particle request only
→ particle/
→ do not generate image/model references unless explicitly requested or materially required

visual/model request only
→ image/
→ do not author particle assets unless explicitly requested

combined request
→ use both branches only for requested/material dependencies
```

Do not force a visual reference step before particle authoring. A particle can be authored directly from text, an existing visual/reference source, or a sufficiently resolved effect brief.

## 4. Simple Question Rule

Ask the fewest basic, immediately answerable questions.

Good:
- "Ukurannya sekitar setinggi pinggang player, setinggi player, atau lebih tinggi?"
- "Kendaraannya cukup untuk 1 player atau 2 player?"
- "Bagian mana yang perlu bergerak?"
- "Particle ini terutama dilihat dari dekat atau sekitar puluhan blok?"
- "Efeknya sekali meledak atau terus looping?"

Do not ask the user for topology, pivot ownership, UV strategy, Molang implementation, deformation terminology, or a better prompt.

## 5. Prompt Compiler

After blocking information is resolved, run `.agents/skills/lazydesigner-prompt-compiler/SKILL.md` when normalization materially helps.

```text
raw user intent
+ confirmed answers
+ approved prior decisions
+ source/reference facts
→ CLEAN PRODUCTION BRIEF
```

Rejected or superseded directions are removed. The compiler may normalize wording but may not invent design, scale, materials, topology, motion, duration, or hidden structure.

The compiled brief is internal working state and is not a default handoff file.

## 6. Branch-specific confirmation

### Visual / model reference

Before generating a new visual artifact whose target materially depends on user decisions, show a concise summary and obtain explicit approval.

Recommended shape:

```text
Konfirmasi sebelum dibuat:
- Objek: <target>
- Skala: <only when material>
- Arah: <main structural/visual direction>
- Tambahan: <only material extras>

Sudah sesuai?
```

Silence is not approval. A material revision requires a new bounded confirmation before the revised visual is generated.

### Particle / VFX reference

Particle-only work uses the dedicated fast path:

```text
BLOCKING ambiguity remains
→ ask the minimum decision-changing question

no BLOCKING ambiguity remains
→ do not request ceremonial pre-confirmation
→ use reversible PROVISIONAL choices for non-blocking unknowns
→ author the first particle pass
→ static QA
→ user review in the target environment when material
```

This exception prevents a simple request such as `buat particle api biru` from being stopped by an image-oriented confirmation ceremony. It does not permit inventing hidden geometry, exact runtime behavior, performance truth, or other blocking facts.

## 7. Reference Capability Branches

### Visual / model reference

Use `image/README.md` and choose only modules that materially reduce downstream uncertainty:

```text
CONCEPT
TURNAROUND
STRUCTURAL_DETAIL
MATERIAL_TEXTURE
RIG_DEFORMATION
POSE_ACTION
EXPRESSION_FACE
ANIMATION_KEYFRAME
```

Do not generate every module by default.

### Particle / VFX reference

Use `.agents/skills/lazydesigner-particle-reference-authoring/SKILL.md` and `particle/README.md`.

Typical authored resources may include:

```text
Bedrock .particle.json
particle textures / atlases when required
static/preflight QA
```

A Resource Pack/ZIP, README, manifest, or `REFERENCE.json` is delivery output and is created only when packaging/handoff is requested. Image reference output is not a prerequisite for this branch.

## 8. Generate + Internal QA

Generation uses the smallest branch-ready authority set, not the uncontrolled full conversation.

Visual/model generation uses the confirmed compiled brief plus approved source/reference authority and scale lock when material.

Particle/VFX authoring uses the normalized particle brief with BLOCKING ambiguity resolved, the minimum required particle knowledge owner(s), and reversible provisional choices where allowed.

Visual/model references use image QA. Particle/VFX references use `particle/qa.md` and only the gates relevant to the authored effect.

## 9. User Review / Correction

A generated image or particle becomes approved reference authority only after explicit user acceptance when visual/runtime review is material.

For correction:

```text
USER DELTA
→ compile CHANGE + PRESERVE when useful
→ resolve only new blockers
→ branch-specific confirmation only when required
→ bounded correction
→ causal QA
→ user review
```

Preserve unaffected approved authority.

## 10. Package Generation Gate

Create package files only when package generation is explicitly authorized or already unambiguously requested in the current instruction.

Authoring a first particle pass does not by itself authorize a final Resource Pack ZIP. Do not create optional files or another reference branch merely to complete a template.

## 11. Package Build

### Visual/model package

Canonical package:

```text
asset_reference/
├── REFERENCE.json
├── GEOMETRY.md
├── TEXTURE.md      ← only when useful
├── ANIMATION.md    ← only when useful / required
└── images/
    └── approved/supporting reference images
```

Canonical owners remain under `package/`.

### Particle/VFX package

Follow `particle/delivery.md` only after package/handoff intent is known. Standalone delivery is an ordinary Bedrock Resource Pack folder/ZIP. `REFERENCE.json` is added only for explicit LazyDesigner/Codex/MCP handoff.

Do not add image-reference files unless they are actually part of the particle request. Do not export the compiled production prompt, conversation transcript, duplicate bootstrap files, or internal scratch QA.

## 12. Package Consistency Gate

Before handoff verify the package-specific contract.

```text
all listed/referenced files exist
identifiers/paths agree
no unsupported facts were introduced
omitted optional files are not referenced
blocking unknowns are resolved or explicitly preserved
```

Fix package plumbing internally. Ask the user only when a real requirement conflict needs their decision.

## 13. Downstream Handoff

For visual/model references, consumption is defined by `package/load-contract.md`.

For particle/VFX references, the clean Resource Pack or canonical particle `REFERENCE.json` package is the handoff boundary only when downstream handoff is requested. Codex/MCP should not need the original ChatGPT transcript or a separate image-reference package.

## 14. Authority Order

```text
explicit current user requirement
→ approved branch-specific reference
→ confirmed scale/view-distance requirement when material
→ canonical branch rules
→ downstream interpretation
```

The compiled brief organizes generation but never outranks approved user/reference facts.

## 15. Stop Conditions

Do not generate when:
- a blocking requirement is unresolved;
- materially conflicting evidence remains unresolved;
- a branch-specific required confirmation is pending;
- a correction would require guessing what must be preserved;
- the proposed artifact does not materially help the downstream decision.

Do not hand off when:
- package consistency fails;
- listed/referenced files are missing;
- readiness contradicts blocking unknowns;
- scale/view-distance authority conflicts internally.

## User Experience Goal

The user should normally only need to:

```text
1. describe what they want
2. answer a few simple questions when vital information is missing
3. approve a concise target summary only when the selected branch materially requires it
4. review the requested reference artifact
5. request/authorize packaging when a package is actually needed
6. receive the completed handoff when requested
```

Prompt quality, branch selection, particle preflight, package consistency, and technical terminology remain responsibilities of the ChatGPT-side system.
