# Particle Knowledge Map

Canonical knowledge map for ChatGPT-side Minecraft Bedrock / Snowstorm particle reference authoring.

## Evidence classes

```text
OFFICIAL BEDROCK
SNOWSTORM / WINTERSKY
EMPIRICALLY VERIFIED
HEURISTIC
```

Official Bedrock semantics outrank editor workarounds. Snowstorm-specific behavior must not redefine generic Bedrock validity. Heuristics must never be presented as live runtime/FPS truth.

```

## Workflow and delivery owners

```text
authoring-spec.md → normalize requested effect
workflow.md       → authoring sequence
qa.md             → static/preflight acceptance
delivery.md       → clean package contract
patterns.md       → reusable physical starting patterns
```

Knowledge and workflow stay separate. Deep technical rules belong to the nearest knowledge owner, not duplicated into workflow files.

## Lazy-read routing

```text

→ authoring-spec.md + workflow.md

spawn/lifetime/shape
→ emitter.md

custom distribution/direction/cone/ring math

general vector/physics/distribution/ballistics
→ math-physics-reference.md

creation/update/render or local/world-space question

→ molang-formula-cookbook.md

query/context/entity-state dependency
→ molang-queries-context.md

→ troubleshooting.md
```

Load multiple files only when the task genuinely crosses boundaries.

## Confidence hierarchy

```text
current explicit user requirement
→ target-version official Bedrock generated schema/reference
→ official semantic/component documentation
→ reproduced Snowstorm/Wintersky behavior for editor-specific issues
→ accepted empirical project evidence
→ conservative heuristic
```

When newer generated schema and older hand-written documentation differ, use the target-version schema for JSON shape/defaults and retain older prose only when it remains semantically compatible.

Further work should close only newly discovered official fields/defaults/version-specific behavior and later empirical visual evidence. Do not create another parallel particle framework.
