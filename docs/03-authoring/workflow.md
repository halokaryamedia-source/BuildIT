# LazyDesigner — Authoring Workflow Policy

**Status:** Active Policy  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Updated:** 2026-09-12

## Purpose

Own durable cross-domain authoring sequence and dependency rules without duplicating specialist procedures. Detailed domain execution remains in the active specialist Skill and its canonical standard.

## Canonical Lifecycle

```text
REFERENCE / REQUIREMENTS
→ GEOMETRY
→ GEOMETRY VERIFY
→ USER APPROVAL or authorized autonomous verification
→ UV LAYOUT / UV PASS
→ TEXTURING
→ TEXTURE VERIFY
→ USER APPROVAL or authorized autonomous verification
→ ANIMATION READINESS when required
→ ANIMATION when required
→ FINALIZATION
→ COMPLETE
```

Geometry and Texturing are distinct semantic owners but share the same `AUTHORING` Runtime surface. Animation uses the separate `ANIMATION` Runtime surface.

```text
GEOMETRY semantic stage  → AUTHORING Runtime surface
TEXTURING semantic stage → AUTHORING Runtime surface
ANIMATION semantic stage → ANIMATION Runtime surface
```

Geometry↔Texturing correction does not require `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` or a Runtime surface switch. `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` is reserved for AUTHORING↔Animation.

## Single-Owner Execution

Normal work activates exactly one semantic specialist:

```text
Geometry / hierarchy / pivots / UV
→ lazydesigner-modelling

Texture / atlas / Painter / material / PBR
→ lazydesigner-texturing

Animation / motion / effects / controllers
→ lazydesigner-animation
```

Control projects only the active-stage context. Geometry may load exactly one selected modelling profile. Do not load sibling specialists or the shared stage contract as reassurance.

## Minimum Necessary Evidence

Reuse fresh exact identity/authored state returned by prior calls when sufficient.

```text
known target + known capability
→ mutate
→ reuse receipt
→ verify only evidence made stale or able to change the verdict
```

Use focused discovery only for unknown, stale, or ambiguous state. Avoid confirmation reads after successful deterministic mutations, screenshot-per-micro-mutation loops, broad status/search/describe rituals, and full-profile/package reloads.

## Geometry

Geometry owns shape, hierarchy, transform ownership, pivots, articulation readiness, openings/negative space, contact, dimensions, and UV Layout semantics.

Use the minimum sufficient Bedrock-native geometry. Representation complexity is earned by silhouette, real volume, negative-space boundary, contact, layering, transform ownership, motion, or a proven technical constraint. Surface-only information belongs in Texture.

A coherent geometry cohort is authored first, then visually/structurally verified. Tool success is execution evidence only.

## UV Layout

UV Layout remains Geometry-owned mapping state. Production UV work follows Geometry approval/authorized verification and must reach UV Layout PASS before Texturing can advance.

A material UV change invalidates only affected downstream texture evidence. Do not globally reset unrelated accepted state.

## Texturing

Texturing owns atlas pixels, palette/material styling, mapped-surface readability, alpha/emissive/PBR intent, identity markings, pattern continuity, and Texture Verify.

Texture must not compensate for a missing/incorrect mass, attachment, opening, hierarchy, or pivot. A proved upstream defect returns to Geometry owner inside the shared AUTHORING surface.

## Animation

Animation begins only after canonical readiness: saved checkpoint, UV Layout PASS, no blockers, and either explicit upstream user approval or explicitly authorized current-revision autonomous verification.

Animation owns motion, timeline, controller composition, animation-bound effects, and playback evidence. It does not own structural rig mutation. A proved hierarchy/pivot/clearance blocker returns to AUTHORING through the Gateway handoff and resumes the same task.

## Verification / Correction

```text
MUTATE coherent cohort
→ VERIFY affected evidence
→ PASS?
   ├─ yes → READY_FOR_USER_REVIEW or next legal stage
   └─ no  → diagnose first material owning cause
            → one bounded correction
            → refresh affected evidence
            → IMPROVED | UNCHANGED | REGRESSED
```

Internal PASS never equals user approval. The same causal direction failing twice without new evidence becomes `BLOCKED` rather than a third guess.

## Dependency Invalidation

Invalidate only what the mutation can materially affect.

```text
Geometry change affecting mapped surfaces
→ affected UV/Texture evidence stale

UV change
→ affected Texture evidence stale

Texture mutation
→ Geometry/UV evidence remains fresh

participating hierarchy/pivot change
→ affected Animation evidence stale

Animation keyframe change
→ Geometry/UV/Texture evidence remains fresh unless a structural blocker is discovered
```

## Persistence

Persist meaningful boundaries such as approval, handoff, resume, park, and completion. Mutation count alone is not a checkpoint trigger. Workspace state is continuation state, not a second Runtime database.

## Proof Boundary

Source/static evidence can establish contracts, ownership, schemas, routing, and deterministic behavior. Installed Runtime freshness, native Blockbench mutation/playback/persistence, visual fidelity, and accepted-result efficiency require matching local/live proof.
