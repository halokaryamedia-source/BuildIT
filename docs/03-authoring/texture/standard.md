# LazyDesigner — UV Layout & Texture Standard

**Status:** Active Policy  
**Version:** 1.8
**Updated:** 2026-09-09

## Purpose

Define durable UV Layout, Texture Atlas, Texture Styling, and Texture Verify rules for Minecraft Bedrock models after geometry is coherent.

This policy separates concepts that must not be collapsed into a generic “texture” step.

## Canonical Vocabulary

```text
GEOMETRY        = 3D form, proportion, topology, attachment
UV LAYOUT       = geometry → atlas coordinate mapping
TEXTURE ATLAS   = bitmap/PNG canvas that stores pixels
TEXTURE STYLING = color/material/shading/detail authored into the atlas
TEXTURE VERIFY  = fresh atlas + mapped-model visual validation
```

Hard boundaries:

- UV Layout contains no color/style decision.
- Texture Atlas creation contains no proof of styling quality.
- Texture Styling does not own geometry shape or UV ownership.
- Texture Verify is evidence, not another authoring pass.
- `create_texture(type=blank)` creates only a **Texture Atlas**. `create_texture(type=template)` delegates UV Layout and template bitmap generation to Blockbench's native generator before Texture Styling.
- `uv_offset`, `autouv`, `mirror_uv`, per-face UV, and `box_uv_region` are **UV Layout** state.
- Painter operations are **Texture Styling**.

## Core Principle

**Texture Styling supports geometry; it does not repair geometry.**

Use styling for color/material identity, pattern, form readability, highlights/shadows, small surface detail, and information that does not need silhouette/real volume/separate motion. If silhouette, proportion, attachment, or required volume is wrong, fix Geometry first.

### Alpha-owned silhouette carrier

The rule above still holds for normal Geometry. Narrow exception: when Geometry has explicitly chosen `PLANAR_CUTOUT_CARRIER`, its plane-like carrier is valid Geometry and alpha intentionally owns only the 2D silhouette/holes inside that carrier. This must not invent missing depth, volume, contact, or motion. Geometry changes carrier count/envelope/orientation/contact; Texturing changes the in-plane alpha. Binary cutout uses 0/255 alpha with a compatible `cutout` / `entity_alphatest` consumer; true translucency remains a separate render contract.

## Production Workflow

```text

UV LAYOUT

UV LOCK / AUDIT

TEXTURE TEMPLATE / ATLAS
  native UV arrangement + exact pixel grid

TEXTURE TREATMENT PLAN
   region + evidence + surface_pattern + render_profile + optional PBR intent

   BASE PASS
   VALUE / FORM PASS
   SURFACE PATTERN PASS
   IDENTITY PASS
   SECONDARY DETAIL PASS
   RENDER / ALPHA VERIFY
↓
TEXTURE VERIFY
↓
FINAL PASS
```

A placeholder/flat fill may make geometry readable early, but it is provisional and is not production completion.

## Native Texture Template

When UVs must be rebuilt, use `create_texture(type=template)` with an explicit `pixel_density` (16x means one model unit per pixel), `rearrange_uv=true`, and the required occupancy/padding/power-of-two settings. The native generator writes the UV arrangement and template bitmap with nearest-pixel behavior. Do not approximate this phase with manually guessed face rectangles, stretched source images, or color-only fills. Inspect the fresh UV audit and atlas before any styling operation.

# UV Layout

## UV Layout Purpose

UV Layout answers only:

> Which atlas region does each model surface read?

It owns mapping, orientation, reuse, mirroring, seams, bounds, and lock state. It does not own palette, shading, material appearance, or detail.

## UV Requirements

Important visible surfaces must have usable finite UVs. For new AI production:

- important faces remain inside the logical canvas;
- require integral physical texel mapping; fractional logical UV is valid when it maps to whole physical pixels;
- accidental partial overlap is rejected;
- exact reuse is allowed when intentionally symmetric/repeated;
- mirror use is deliberate;
- directional/asymmetric markings have suitable orientation;
- seam-critical relationships are known before Texture Styling.

Do not optimize atlas occupancy as a quality score.
Native packing alone is not a production layout verdict. Organize exact native islands into named semantic zones (body, head, appendages) with stable order and gutters; translate islands without changing their native aspect or density. A scattered atlas that is hard to identify/edit fails this gate even when all UVs are valid.

## Box UV / UV Lock

Box UV is a first-class Bedrock workflow.

For fresh AI-authored Box UV:

```text
manage_cubes(operation=create)
→ deterministic initial uv_offset / returned box_uv_region
→ geometry correction while autouv remains active
→ explicit Geometry APPROVED
→ one coherent final UV lock with autouv=0
→ list_textures global audit
→ TEXTURE ATLAS
→ TEXTURE STYLING
```

Do not manually recalculate a fresh `box_uv_region` already returned by `manage_cubes`. Use `inspect_elements(mode=detail)` only when face-specific mapping/orientation is actually required.

Per-face authored UV follows explicit face rectangles.

## Global UV Audit

The audit distinguishes at least:

```text
invalid/non-finite UV
out-of-bounds faces
fractional UV candidates
unlocked Box-UV Cubes
exact reused regions
partial-overlap candidates
```

Exact reuse can be correct. Partial overlap is a review condition because it can silently corrupt unrelated styled regions. Degenerate/zero-area UV may occur on sheet/zero-thickness geometry and is not automatically a defect.

## UV Stability

Do not change UV Layout after substantial Texture Styling without a concrete reason.

A material UV change invalidates affected downstream assumptions:

- mapped physical region;
- orientation;
- seam continuity;
- shared/reused pixels;
- styled alignment;
- variant alignment;
- PBR/channel alignment where applicable.

Re-check only affected downstream state.

# Texture Atlas

## Atlas Purpose

Texture Atlas is the bitmap/PNG canvas that stores pixels. It is separate from logical UV mapping and separate from styling.

## AI Authoring Canvas Standard

For **new AI-authored Bedrock Entity projects**, logical UV is **128×128 by default**, with **256×256 opt-in**.

The production base-color bitmap uses explicit square 128-based sizes:

```text
128×128
256×256
384×384
512×512
...
```

Choose the smallest sufficient bitmap. Logical UV dimensions and physical bitmap dimensions are different concepts.

```text
128 logical → 128 bitmap = 1× physical pixels per UV unit
128 logical → 256 bitmap = 2×
128 logical → 512 bitmap = 4×
```

Iterative/non-production work may use provisional square 16-based canvases `16..1024`; promote to 128-based before final production. Imported/existing assets may preserve authored nonstandard dimensions.

## Single Base-Color Atlas

Normal production uses **one base-color atlas PNG for the whole model**. Do not create base-color atlases per body part, Cube, material family, or object section.

```text
no base atlas            → create one
one base atlas           → reuse it
multiple base candidates → resolve fragmentation first
```

An explicit color variant may reuse the established Geometry + UV Layout but belongs to an explicit non-material TextureGroup.

Normal/height/MER are PBR support atlas channels. They do not change UV Layout ownership and should match the base bitmap size for new AI authoring.

## Atlas Identity

Retain the base atlas UUID as continuation state and pass `texture_id` explicitly whenever multiple textures are present. Do not rely on whichever texture happens to be selected/default.

Creating an atlas, clearing it, or filling it with one color is **not Texture Styling completion**.
Pixels outside mapped islands stay transparent, apart from deliberate bounded edge padding. Opaque render intent applies to mapped surfaces; it does not require filling unused atlas space. Full-atlas alpha statistics must not trigger an opaque background fill.

# Texture Styling

## Styling Purpose

Texture Styling owns the visual pixels:

```text
palette
material separation
surface_pattern
value / hue
face/form readability
contact / occlusion
edge treatment
identity-critical marks
controlled secondary detail
```

Before detailed styling establish physical pixels per UV unit and readable detail scale.

## Treatment Plan

Before broad painting, convert approved reference evidence into semantic regions. Each region independently records:

```text
reference evidence state
surface_pattern
render_profile / minecraft_material_code
optional pbr_intent
identity colors / notes
```

`surface_pattern` describes visual pixel language only. `render_profile` describes Minecraft render behavior only. PBR remains optional and explicit. Missing evidence stays unresolved; object/category names never fill it automatically.

## Material-Family Palette Ramps

A production texture uses material-aware ramps, not one global brightness ladder and not one flat color per material.

Relevant roles include:

```text
base
shadow / deep shadow when needed
highlight / edge highlight when needed
controlled hue movement
material-specific secondary hue
identity/accent color
```

Reason about **value and hue**. Brightness-only ramps often look procedural and lifeless.

## BASE PASS

The base pass establishes primary/secondary colors, material zones, accent/focal colors, and basic value separation.

A flat fill is only a **BASE PASS** when supported form/material/detail exists. No important required surface should remain unintentionally blank.

## VALUE / FORM PASS

Add controlled information that helps geometry read:

```text
face/form separation
material-specific shadow/highlight
local form transition
contact / occlusion
edge treatment
value / hue ramp
```

Prefer stepped pixel ramps for Minecraft/pixel-art styling. Continuous smooth gradients are optional only when the requested style/reference needs them.
Require visible, intentional pixel clusters at normal mapped-model scale with Shading ON: distinct value masses, form-following folds and readable identity accents. Barely visible noise or low-contrast formula variation remains BASE_ONLY; coverage/variation counts cannot upgrade it to STYLED.

Texture may reinforce real contact/recess/overlap/underside/joint depth but must not invent missing large volume.

## SURFACE PATTERN PASS

Apply the selected `surface_pattern` recipe to each material cohort only after BASE and VALUE/FORM are readable. Recipes describe directionality, cluster language, value behavior, edge behavior, secondary detail, and anti-patterns. They are not bitmap presets and never select transparency/glow/PBR by name.

Examples include `wood_grain`, `painted_metal`, `stone_cluster`, `cloth_weave`, `clean_glass`, `rubber_matte`, `fur_cluster`, and `emissive_panel`. Reference evidence overrides the generic recipe.

## IDENTITY PASS

Identity-critical features include required markings, facial features, emblems, wraps, seams, panel lines, symbols, and recognizability-critical color breaks.

Identity comes before microdetail.

## SECONDARY DETAIL PASS

Use controlled material variation at the chosen physical pixels-per-UV-unit scale. Noise-first painting is rejected.

For crisp Minecraft texture:

- use deliberate pixel clusters;
- use hard texel edges;
- avoid accidental softness/antialiasing;
- for ordinary opacity/cutout authoring, default authored alpha intent is **0 or 255**.

Intermediate alpha is valid only when material behavior requires translucency/blending **or another declared non-opacity alpha semantic such as color/emissive masking**. Never classify the byte range before resolving `render_profile`.

## Render Material / Alpha Contract

Alpha meaning is downstream-material dependent and must not be inferred from PNG/TGA pixels alone:

- opaque/default entity rendering uses the normal `entity` material;
- cutout transparency requires a compatible alpha-test consumer such as `entity_alphatest`;
- true translucency requires a blending consumer such as `entity_alphablend`;
- `entity_change_color` uses alpha as a color mask;
- `entity_emissive` uses alpha as emissive intensity and requires TGA;
- emissive/translucent and layered variants have their own declared contracts.

Use `manage_render_profile` to inspect/bind `client_entity.description.materials` and ordered render-controller bone assignments. `render_mode` remains Blockbench preview state and is not Minecraft runtime proof.

If the downstream client-entity/render material is unknown, alpha-dependent appearance is **UNVERIFIED**. A texture-wide intermediate-alpha scan is only a candidate signal because one atlas can serve bones using different render profiles. Do not treat a transparent-looking atlas preview as Minecraft runtime proof.

## Paint Safety / Atomic Authoring

Use existing Blockbench Painter controls only when they protect declared intent:

- `pixel_perfect` for crisp freehand pixel clusters;
- `lock_alpha` for recolor that must preserve transparent regions;
- `paint_side_restrict` when freehand work could bleed onto another face;
- mirror painting only after left/right semantic symmetry is established.

For a known non-layered target with a fresh texture revision, `paint_texture_transaction` is preferred for one bounded exact-pixel batch because it provides optimistic stale-state protection and one Undo unit. Layered artistic work stays with native Painter tools.

## Mirror / Reuse

Shared/mirrored UV regions are intentional only when surfaces should share pixels.

Avoid shared regions for text/symbols, left/right-specific detail, directional marks, deliberate asymmetric wear, and unique identity features. Change UV Layout ownership before styling unique content.

## PBR Boundary

PBR is optional and evidence-driven.

Normal/height/MER are support Texture Atlases. PBR does not replace Texture Styling quality and does not justify base-atlas fragmentation.

For active variants/PBR, `list_textures.production_alignment.gate` is the technical consistency gate:

- dependent bitmap dimensions and logical UV mapping must remain aligned with the single production base atlas;
- one material owns at most one texture per semantic PBR channel;
- `normal` and `height` are mutually exclusive depth sources;
- PBR support textures must belong to a material TextureGroup;
- detached superseded support textures are inventory, not an active production failure.

PBR channel images are **data maps**, not ordinary color styling:

- normal RGB encodes surface direction and is an alternative to height;
- height is scalar displacement information and must not coexist with normal in one texture set;
- MER RGB maps Red=Metalness, Green=Emissive, Blue=Roughness.

Do not invent normal/MER data from palette intuition. Use material preview/reference evidence and keep unsupported or unverified PBR intent explicit.

`production_alignment=ready` proves mapping/channel consistency only. It does not prove that normal/MER values are artistically good or that the Minecraft runtime consumer is configured correctly.

# Texture Verify

## Verification Purpose

Texture Verify asks whether the atlas pixels, when mapped through the final UV Layout onto the model, produce the intended result.

Required evidence for visual claims:

```text
fresh Texture Atlas image
+
fresh affected model view(s)
```

Review in this order:

```text
1. UV Layout validity / bounds / overlap / lock
2. Texture Atlas ownership / fragmentation / scale
3. treatment-plan region ownership + palette/material separation
4. form + contact + edge readability
5. surface-pattern language
6. render/alpha contract
7. seam / orientation
8. identity-critical marks
9. secondary detail density
```

`Texture Atlas exists`, `UV Layout exists`, or `paint tool succeeded` does not prove Texture Styling quality.

Texture mutation makes visual evidence stale. Correct only diagnosed failures and re-check affected evidence.

## Completion Criteria

Requested texture scope is complete when:

- Geometry dependency is coherent;
- UV Layout is finite, in-bounds, stable, correctly oriented, and final Box UV is locked;
- no unresolved accidental partial overlap remains;
- exactly one intended base-color Texture Atlas exists unless explicit variants are required;
- atlas identity and physical pixel density are known;
- material families have readable palette/value separation;
- visible form is not left as unjustified flat fill;
- reference-important regions have explicit surface treatment instead of generic noise;
- contact/edge treatment is used when materially useful;
- identity-critical markings are present;
- detail density matches physical pixels-per-UV-unit;
- no accidental soft/alpha artifacts remain for crisp pixel style;
- active variants/PBR have `production_alignment.gate=ready`;
- alpha-dependent appearance has a known downstream `render_profile`/material contract or remains explicitly UNVERIFIED;
- Texture Verify has no unresolved critical/major issue.
