# BlockIT — Geometry Standard

**Status:** Active Policy  
**Version:** 2.1  
**Updated:** 2026-09-12

## Purpose

Define object-agnostic geometry-quality rules for Minecraft Bedrock Entity models created through MCP. Professional `.bbmodel` samples are **evidence of modelling decisions**, not presets, anatomy rules, fixed Cube counts, asset classes, or complexity targets.

## Core Principle

Use the **minimum geometry required to preserve correct 3D form**, not the minimum Cube count.

Every material Cuboid must have a modelling purpose in the **whole form**. Its 3D purpose is silhouette, real volume, opening/negative-space boundary, contact, 3D layering, transform ownership, or motion. Surface information that does not need those properties belongs in Texture; unsupported/immaterial detail may be omitted.

A Cube existing, touching, overlapping, being parented, or being accepted by a tool is structural state only. It does not prove correct representation, size, placement, orientation, hierarchy, pivot, or surface integrity.

## Whole-Form Contract

```

There is no universal support-first, section-first, largest-first, fixed-Cube count, asset preset, watertight requirement, or per-Cube approval order. Construction patterns are **not presets**.

## Minimum Evidence

Reuse fresh authored state and request only evidence that can change the next decision. `inspect_model_bounds` is only for material envelope/scale/ground/displacement or bounded surface/contact questions. Tool success, bounds, hierarchy, or diagnostics never create visual PASS.

## Representation Choice

Choose the simplest construction that preserves the visible 3D requirement:

- **solid Cuboid / `SOLID_CUBOID`** — real volume or silhouette-bearing mass;
- **thin or zero-thickness plane-like Cube / `PLANE_LIKE`** — genuinely sheet-like geometry where thickness is not material;
- **planar cutout carrier / `PLANAR_CUTOUT_CARRIER`** — plane-like host whose alpha texture owns the internal silhouette;
- **layered surface / `LAYERED_SURFACE`** — visible layer over/inside an established form;
- **linked meaningful segments / `SEGMENTED_FORM`** — bend/curve/articulated chain requiring purposeful pieces;
- **texture-only / `TEXTURE`** — surface information requiring no 3D behavior;
- **`OMIT`** — unsupported or immaterial detail.

Rules:

- A plane-like Cube is not a shortcut for unknown depth.
- Zero span on exactly one axis can be valid plane-like Geometry. Two or more collapsed axes do not form a usable surface carrier.
- `inflate` is layer-control, not proportion repair or fake detail. Its sign and magnitude are local authored choices; do not impose a **positive-only or fixed-value rule**.
- Linked meaningful segments must express real changes of direction/contact; reject micro-segmentation and **unit-Cube staircasing** used only to imitate a curve.
- A visible marking, color break, scratch, seam, painted line, or shallow graphic feature stays Texture unless it materially changes 3D behavior.

### Planar cutout carrier

`PLANAR_CUTOUT_CARRIER` is part of the normal native Geometry path, **not a new modelling strategy or object preset**. Use it when broad plane-like faces are the minimum host for a texture/alpha silhouette and the cut-out feature needs no material depth, volume, contact, or independent motion.

- Geometry owns carrier count, envelope, placement, orientation, contact, parent, and pivot; Texture owns silhouette/holes inside carrier bounds.
- **Small-detail thresholds measure the visible feature, not incidental carrier thickness.**
- Prefer `SINGLE`; when yaw coverage needs a cross, `CROSSED_PAIR` uses two co-centered plane-like Cubes about 90° apart under one shared transform and one coherent creation batch. More planes need explicit evidence.
- Do not decompose alpha-owned repeated subfeatures into micro-Cubes.

## Transform Ownership

Decide who owns a transform before choosing rotation values.

### Cube-owned transform

Use when one rigid local part alone needs the orientation and no shared semantic child relationship depends on that transform.

### Group/Bone-owned transform

Use when several Cubes form one semantic segment, attachment, or articulated part whose orientation should move together, or when parent-child transform continuity is itself part of the form.

Do not rotate many child Cubes independently when one shared semantic transform explains the same structure. **Do not create hierarchy solely to increase depth or node count.**

### Primary hierarchy timing

A Group/Bone/pivot belongs in the primary blockout when it is required to establish primary form/orientation, attachment/contact, articulation/segment continuity, or shared transform ownership. Neutral organization may wait until after primary PASS.

## Initial Cube Creation

Every new Cube requires explicit finite `from` and `to`. Do not create default placeholder Cubes merely to have geometry and decide later.

When a specific parent Group/bone is intended, use exact UUID or unique target. Missing/ambiguous targets fail closed.

```text
rotation = [0,0,0]
→ valid when orientation decision is AXIS_ALIGNED

any non-zero rotation
→ explicit origin/pivot required
```

## Dimensions / Coordinate Frame

```text
X = width / left-right
Y = height / up-down
Z = length / front-back
front direction = explicit
ground relationship = explicit
```

Approved dimensions are numeric target authority. Reference pixels/panel size are not geometry calibration.

## Rotation

**Rotation is justified when** the reference visibly requires an angled orientation/slope, a rotated Cuboid represents that orientation more coherently than an intentional stepped construction, or articulation/shared segment motion requires it.

Before material rotation, identify evidence, transform owner, pivot role, and relationship it should improve. Reject arbitrary multi-axis rotations, rotation used to compensate for wrong size/placement, accumulating small angle changes after failed corrections, or syntactically valid rotation treated as proof.

For an unrotated Cube receiving non-zero rotation, **explicit origin/pivot required** before mutation. An already rotated Cube may reuse its known existing pivot when only rotation changes.

## Pivot / Origin

A meaningful pivot serves rotation center, joint/articulation, attachment, or parent/group transform. A geometric center is only a provisional fallback when no material attachment/joint/parent evidence exists.

Pivot-only correction changes origin without changing visible placement. Group pivot changes use exact identity and native transfer-origin semantics.

## Primary vs Secondary Geometry

Primary geometry is the minimum Cuboids plus **required primary hierarchy/pivots** that establish identity, global silhouette, primary volume, principal orientation, contact, and articulation. Secondary geometry adds only grounded silhouette refinement, attachment/layering, motion support, or visible detail after primary form passes.

Secondary complexity is **identity-weighted**. Do not subdivide every region uniformly or add rotation noise to look detailed.

## Cuboid Efficiency

Cube efficiency is representation-first, never a fixed count target.

Before adding a secondary Cube, ask whether the feature needs 3D silhouette, real volume, contact, negative-space boundary, 3D layering, transform ownership, or motion. If none apply and Texture can carry the visible information, use Texture.

Detail-only span/thickness `<= 4 Blockbench units` is an **anti-overcube guardrail, not a classifier**. It triggers a stronger representation challenge; it does not forbid Geometry when the small feature genuinely carries required 3D form.

Prefer fewer meaningful Cuboids over dense approximations. Split a mass only for demonstrated different silhouette/orientation, separate transform/pivot/motion, genuinely separate visible volume, or verified technical constraint. Adding another Cube is not the default correction.

### Adaptive Cuboid Budget

There is **no universal Cube-count cap**. Complexity budget is earned by visible or functional need.

Each proposed Cube must pass at least one **Marginal Geometry Value** test:

```text
SILHOUETTE      changes a material visible contour
VOLUME          creates a materially distinct 3D mass/depth
NEGATIVE_SPACE  owns an opening/cutout boundary that Texture cannot own
CONTACT         establishes a visible attachment/contact surface
LAYERING        creates a materially separate 3D layer/inset/overhang
TRANSFORM       requires independent/shared transform ownership
MOTION          participates in articulation, clearance, or deformation spacing
TECHNICAL       satisfies a proven Bedrock/export/UV constraint
```

If a proposed Cube passes none of these tests, it is **REDUNDANT_GEOMETRY** and must be represented by Texture, merged into an existing mass, or omitted.

A Cube is not justified merely because:

- the reference contains a small color/shading boundary;
- more segments make a curve look numerically smoother;
- a neighboring Cube already exists;
- a tool can create it cheaply;
- symmetry makes it easy to duplicate;
- it hides a gap caused by a wrong primary mass;
- it increases apparent modelling detail.

### Representation Ladder

Use the lowest-complexity native representation that preserves the requirement:

```text
1. TEXTURE / alpha detail
2. one SOLID_CUBOID or PLANE_LIKE carrier
3. one rotated Cuboid
4. one LAYERED_SURFACE relation
5. CROSSED_PAIR cutout carrier when view coverage requires it
6. small SEGMENTED_FORM cohort
7. denser segmented approximation only after lower levels visibly fail
```

Escalate **one level at a time**. Do not jump directly to dense segmentation.

A more complex level is justified only when the simpler level causes a material failure in one of:

```text
silhouette
volume/depth
opening/negative space
contact/layering
motion/articulation
reference-critical identity landmark
```

### Segmented Curve Rule

A curved/organic/sloped form may use several rotated Cuboids, but every segment must own a meaningful change of direction, silhouette, contact, or articulation.

Reject:

```text
micro-segments whose removal is visually immaterial
unit-Cube staircasing used as generic smoothing
multiple almost-collinear segments with no visible contour benefit
hidden segments that only fill internal volume
```

Prefer the **coarsest segment count that preserves the required contour** at the relevant reference/model viewing scale.

For articulated chains, segment count may be driven by motion topology rather than static smoothness; do not merge across a required joint.

### Merge / Remove Challenge

Before secondary Geometry PASS, perform one cohort-level simplification challenge:

```text
For each dense/repeated cohort:
- can adjacent Cuboids merge without changing a material contour?
- can a repeated surface detail move to Texture?
- can one rotated Cuboid replace several stepped Cuboids?
- can alpha own the internal silhouette on a planar carrier?
- is any Cube compensating for an incorrect neighboring mass?
```

Only mutate when the answer is evidence-backed; this is not an automatic simplifier.

The intended outcome is **minimum sufficient geometry**, not minimum node count.

### Complexity Escalation Gate

Before adding a dense cohort (`>= 4` new Cuboids for one local feature), record a compact reason:

```text
feature
simpler representation attempted/considered
material failure of the simpler representation
why the proposed cohort fixes that failure
```

This reasoning is transient; do not create a persistent per-Cube bureaucracy.

Repeated/symmetric cohorts should still be authored in one coherent batch after the representation decision is made.

## Surface Integrity Contract

Surface integrity means **every material surface relationship is intentional**, **not that every model is universally watertight**.

```text
CLOSED_BOUNDARY
INTENTIONAL_OPENING
LAYERED_OFFSET
INTENTIONAL_INTERSECTION
CUTOUT_CARRIER
```

When adjacency, layering, or contact is material, combine fresh whole-form views with one bounded `inspect_model_bounds` review. Runtime hints such as `z_fighting`, `micro_gap`, `coplanar_edge_gap`, or `shallow_penetration` require judgement; they are not semantic verdicts.

Required closed boundaries must not contain visible uncovered gaps. Intentional openings remain open. Hidden structural intersection may be intentional. A valid plane-like carrier is not degenerate merely because one axis has zero span.

Geometry PASS requires no unresolved material surface risk. A clean diagnostic does not create visual PASS, and positive-volume overlap never proves contact.

## Attachment / Contact

Visible connection quality is judged visually. **AABB overlap or hierarchy alone is not proof.** Avoid floating required parts, accidental penetration, exposed coplanar overlap, excessive unreadable intersection, or compensating Cubes used to conceal a wrong mass relationship.

## Correction Vocabulary

```text
TRANSLATE    placement wrong
RESIZE       extent/proportion wrong
ROTATE       orientation/slope wrong
REATTACH     contact/parent wrong
LAYER OFFSET visible layer separation/inset wrong
SPLIT        distinct orientation/volume genuinely needed
MERGE/REMOVE unnecessary or compensating geometry
ADD MASS     required visible volume genuinely missing
```

`LAYER OFFSET` describes the cause, not a mandatory numeric mechanism. Use `ADD MASS` only when evidence shows missing volume.

## Correction Accuracy Contract

Reuse fresh exact authored state when sufficient. Call `inspect_elements(mode=detail)` once only when required current state is missing or stale.

Before mutation declare:

```text
mismatch + supporting view(s)
causal class
exact target UUID(s)
current authored state
invariant(s) that must remain unchanged
expected structural effect
```

After `manage_cubes(operation=update|batch_update)`, inspect returned `geometry_effect` fields such as `changed_fields`, `center_delta`, `size_delta`, `rotation_delta`, `origin_delta`, `inflate_delta`, and visibility change. If the structural effect violates the declared invariant, the correction is invalid before visual review.

Only after structural effect matches intent should fresh affected views decide `IMPROVED | UNCHANGED | REGRESSED`. Same causal correction failing twice without new evidence → stop and reframe.

## Geometry vs Texture

Use Geometry for required 3D behavior. Use Texture for surface information. Texture must not hide incorrect Geometry, but Geometry must not duplicate detail that Texture can carry without changing the 3D requirement.

## Symmetry

Use symmetry/mirroring only when the reference supports it. Preserve meaningful asymmetry. Do not infer hidden features from symmetry without evidence.

## Hierarchy / Naming

Hierarchy exists for transform ownership, articulation, attachment, or useful organization. Use semantic names and stable UUIDs for mutation identity. Hierarchy never justifies bad placement/pivot/contact.

## Functional Anchors / Locators

A required non-visible effect, hold, or attachment point that needs transform identity but no visible volume is **Locator intent**, not a hidden/placeholder Cube.

## Completion Criteria

Geometry is ready for UV/texture only when whole primary form passed visual review, representation choices match the visible 3D requirement, small/detail Geometry survived the guardrail challenge, dense cohorts survived the merge/remove challenge, major proportions/contacts are coherent, required surface relationships are intentional, material shared transforms have an owner, required primary hierarchy/pivots are established, each material rotation/pivot has a reason, Cuboid count is purposeful, no major geometry issue remains, and visual claims use fresh current-revision evidence.
