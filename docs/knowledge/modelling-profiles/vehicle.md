# LazyDesigner Modelling Profile — VEHICLE

Updated: 2026-09-11

This profile is a lightweight modelling knowledge layer for vehicle assets. It complements `lazydesigner-modelling` and the approved reference package. It is **not** a preset geometry recipe and must never override visible reference evidence or explicit user requirements.

## Scope

Use for vehicles where transport identity and vehicle-specific assemblies materially affect modelling decisions, including:

```text
cars
motorcycles
bicycles/carts
trains/rail vehicles
aircraft
boats/watercraft
construction/service vehicles
fantasy/sci-fi vehicles
```

Use `MECHANICAL` instead when mechanism/kinematics are the dominant identity and transport behavior is secondary.

## Core Interpretation Order

Resolve the vehicle in this order:

```text
overall envelope / stance
→ primary body/chassis
→ running/ground-contact system
→ cabin/cockpit/operator volume
→ front/rear identity
→ articulated/moving assemblies
→ secondary structural details
→ surface-only detail
```

Do not start with lights, grilles, trim, bolts, or other small features before the body, stance, wheel/track relationship, and major silhouette are correct.

## Semantic Assembly Vocabulary

Use only assemblies supported by the approved reference. Typical vehicle-level semantic parts may include:

```text
body / chassis
cab / cockpit
hood / bonnet
roof / canopy
front_module
rear_module
wheel_front_left / wheel_front_right
wheel_rear_left / wheel_rear_right
track_left / track_right
axle / bogie / suspension-visible cohort
bumper / fender / guard
windshield / window cohort
door / hatch / trunk / hood panel
seat / handlebar / steering wheel
rotor / propeller / wing / rudder
mast / crane arm / bucket / attachment
light cohort
exhaust / intake
```

Names are semantic identifiers, not instructions to create all listed parts.

## Vehicle Proportion Contract

Before detailed construction, resolve only the relationships that materially control recognition:

```text
width : height : length
wheelbase / axle spacing when visible
track width / left-right running-gear spacing
ground clearance
body-to-wheel/track proportion
cab/cockpit placement
front overhang / rear overhang
roofline or upper silhouette
major taper / slope / curvature direction
```

Never infer engineering dimensions from a photo unless explicitly provided. Use the approved whole-model dimensions as numeric authority and the reference for proportion distribution inside that envelope.

## Running / Ground-Contact System

For wheels, tracks, skids, floats, landing gear, or other support systems:

- preserve required count and cohort relationships;
- preserve ground-contact height and stance;
- check left/right symmetry only when the reference supports it;
- preserve visible wheel/track diameter-to-body relationship;
- preserve axle/track spacing when identity-critical;
- do not let running gear float, sink, or detach from its visible mounting relationship;
- do not create hidden axles/suspension as fact when the reference does not establish them.

If wheels or tracks animate, keep them as semantically separable motion participants with sensible rotation/pivot ownership.

## Front / Rear Identity

Vehicles often depend on orientation-specific identity. Explicitly resolve:

```text
front marker(s)
rear marker(s)
left/right asymmetry if any
operator/cockpit facing
lighting/bumper/grille arrangement
exhaust/intake placement
```

Do not mirror an asymmetric vehicle for convenience.

## Cabin / Cockpit / Openings

When present, preserve:

- window/opening silhouette;
- windshield rake or canopy form when visible;
- door/hatch boundaries that materially change geometry;
- seat/operator region only when visually supported;
- open vs closed cockpit state;
- negative spaces around frame/handlebar/cage structures.

A dark window is not automatically a cavity. Distinguish material/glass from actual opening using supporting views.

## Articulated and Moving Assemblies

Typical motion categories:

```text
ROTATE_CONTINUOUS   wheel / rotor / propeller
ROTATE_BOUNDED      steering / rudder / door / hatch
HINGE               door / ramp / hood / bucket
TRANSLATE           slider / piston / retractable panel
CHAINED_ARTICULATION arm / crane / excavator assembly
STATIC               fixed body/trim
```

For each material moving part, preserve:

```text
semantic parent
motion type
axis intent
pivot region
clearance
closed/open contact invariant when applicable
```

Do not invent mechanical linkage detail merely because a real vehicle would usually contain it.

## Geometry vs Texture Ownership

Use Geometry for:

```text
major body silhouette
wheel/track volume
cab/cockpit volume
fenders/guards that affect silhouette
openings and negative-space boundaries
bumpers / exposed structural bars
movable doors/hatches/panels
rotor/propeller/wing geometry
large lights/intakes/exhausts when volumetric
```

Prefer Texture for:

```text
panel lines
paint graphics
logos/markings
grille pattern when surface-only
minor seams
small warning labels
flat light graphics when no volume is required
surface wear
```

Use plane/cutout representation only where the reference and alpha-owned silhouette justify it.

## Repeated and Symmetric Cohorts

Wheels, windows, seats, lights, track links, vents, and similar repeated elements should be treated as semantic cohorts when appropriate.

```text
resolve one cohort relationship
→ derive repeated placement consistently
→ preserve intentional asymmetry
```

Do not model repeated elements as unrelated guesses. Do not force symmetry where the reference shows asymmetry.

## Useful Reference Views

For whole-vehicle modelling, the most decision-critical views are commonly:

```text
FRONT      → width / front identity / wheel-track stance
LEFT       → length / wheelbase / profile / cab placement
BACK       → rear identity / taper / rear attachments
TOP        → footprint / width-length relationships / roof-cockpit layout
FRONT-LEFT 3/4 → supplemental volume / layering / attachment readability
```

Use only source-supported views. Additional structural detail should target occluded mechanisms or assemblies, not duplicate already-clear views.

## Vehicle-Specific Verification Priorities

Before detail polish, verify in this order:

```text
1. overall silhouette and stance
2. primary body/chassis proportion
3. wheel/track count, spacing and ground contact
4. front/rear orientation correctness
5. cabin/cockpit placement and openings
6. attachment topology
7. articulated-part pivots/clearance when relevant
8. repeated cohort consistency
9. secondary geometry
10. surface-only details
```

A visually correct grille does not compensate for the wrong wheelbase, stance, cabin position, or body silhouette.

## Common Failure Modes

Reject or correct these early:

```text
wrong wheel count or wheel/track spacing
vehicle floating above ground
body volume too narrow/wide/tall relative to reference
front/rear reversed or visually ambiguous
mirrored asymmetric details
wheels detached from body relationship
cockpit/cab placed incorrectly
openings filled with geometry
moving door/rotor/steering merged into fixed body
rotor/propeller pivot placed away from its visible axis
micro-cube over-detail before primary form is correct
surface markings represented as unnecessary geometry
hidden mechanical structure invented as fact
```

## Reference Package Handoff Expectations

When `profile = VEHICLE`, useful structured fields include, when supported:

```text
semantic parts
front/rear orientation
running-gear cohort
symmetry/asymmetry
primary attachment relationships
moving parts
motion type
pivot region
material regions
blocking unknowns
```

If wheel count, major attachment, orientation, or articulation is unresolved and it can change construction, keep it `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_REVIEW`; do not let Codex invent it.

## Efficiency Rules

- Do not inspect or reason about every small component before a judgeable vehicle blockout exists.
- Build repeated cohorts coherently rather than one element at a time.
- Reuse fresh reference/model evidence for bounded corrections.
- Correct the largest structural difference first.
- Do not recapture every canonical view after a local edit; recapture affected views plus any view needed for regression risk.

## Completion Condition

The VEHICLE profile has done its job when Codex can identify the vehicle's primary body, stance/running system, orientation, key assemblies, motion-bearing parts, and material-vs-geometry responsibilities without relying on generic real-world assumptions.
