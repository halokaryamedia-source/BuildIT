# LazyDesigner Reference Preparation

Single ChatGPT-side orchestration authority for preparing references before optional downstream Codex/LazyDesigner authoring. It routes to existing canonical owners rather than duplicating them.

## Route

```text
USER REQUEST
→ UNDERSTAND
→ REQUIREMENT GATE
→ resolve BLOCKING unknowns only
→ PROMPT COMPILER when normalization helps
→ CLASSIFY CAPABILITY
   ├─ VISUAL / MODEL
   │  → bounded final confirmation when material
   │  → image reference owners
   │  → image QA / user visual approval
   ├─ PARTICLE / VFX
   │  → lazydesigner-particle-reference-authoring
   │  → no ceremonial pre-confirmation when no BLOCKING ambiguity remains
   │  → particle QA / target-environment review when material
   └─ BOTH
      → use each branch only for the dependency it owns
→ PACKAGE ONLY WHEN REQUESTED
→ CONSISTENCY GATE when a package/handoff exists
→ OPTIONAL DOWNSTREAM HANDOFF
```

## Boundary

ChatGPT Reference Preparation owns:
- requirement clarification;
- prompt normalization when useful;
- branch selection;
- image-reference planning/generation/editing for the visual branch;
- particle-reference delegation for the particle branch;
- branch-specific QA coordination;
- package creation only when requested.

It does **not** own:
- Blockbench modelling implementation;
- exact Cube coordinates/counts;
- exact pivots or UV placement;
- Runtime Tool call planning;
- final animation key authoring;
- MCP/Gateway implementation;
- live Minecraft/Blockbench truth unless actually observed.

## Input authority

Accept text, user image(s), text + image(s), previously approved references, or bounded corrections.

Resolve facts in this order:

```text
explicit current user requirement
→ visible source evidence
→ approved prior target decision
→ canonical branch rules
→ unresolved remains UNKNOWN
```

Never infer numeric scale from pixels. Never silently average materially conflicting evidence.

## Requirement gate

Classify missing information:

```text
BLOCKING
USEFUL
OPTIONAL
```

`BLOCKING` means the answer can materially change identity, primary structure, scale/viewing distance, required articulation/motion, or another major output decision.

When BLOCKING information is missing:
- do not generate/author the affected branch yet;
- ask only the fewest decision-changing questions;
- use basic user-facing wording;
- never ask the user for topology, pivot ownership, UV strategy, Molang implementation, or prompting terminology.

`USEFUL` is asked only when the expected gain is material. `OPTIONAL` remains unspecified unless evidence resolves it.

### Particle-only exception

Particle/VFX work does **not** inherit the image branch's hard pre-generation confirmation ceremony.

```text
BLOCKING particle ambiguity remains
→ ask minimum question

no BLOCKING particle ambiguity remains
→ delegate directly to lazydesigner-particle-reference-authoring
→ allow conservative reversible PROVISIONAL choices under particle/authoring-spec.md
→ author first pass
→ relevant static QA
→ user target-environment review when material
```

This exception applies only to particle/VFX authoring. It does not permit guessing hidden geometry, runtime truth, exact performance, or other blocking facts.

## Prompt compiler

After blocking information is resolved, use `lazydesigner-prompt-compiler` when normalization materially helps.

The compiler may organize, normalize wording, remove superseded directions, and deduplicate. It may not invent dimensions, materials, topology, animation requirements, hidden structure, motion, or unsupported design choices.

The compiled brief is internal working state and is not exported by default.

## Visual/model confirmation — hard gate when material

For a new **visual/model** artifact whose target materially depends on user decisions, show a concise confirmation and obtain explicit approval before image generation.

Preferred shape:

```text
Konfirmasi sebelum dibuat:
- Objek: <asset>
- Skala: <only when material>
- Arah: <main target>
- Tambahan: <only material extras>

Sudah sesuai?
```

Silence is not approval. A materially revised visual target requires another bounded confirmation.

Do not apply this ceremony to a particle-only request that already has no BLOCKING ambiguity.

## Visual/model branch

Use the minimum evidence that reduces downstream uncertainty.

Possible modules:

```text
CONCEPT
TURNAROUND
STRUCTURAL_DETAIL
MATERIAL_TEXTURE
RIG_DEFORMATION
POSE_ACTION
EXPRESSION_FACE
ANIMATION_KEYFRAME
```

Do not generate every module by default. `docs/02-reference/image/standard.md` owns panel economy and layout. `scale-and-escalation.md` owns player/world scale and multi-sheet escalation. `prompt-contract.md` + `master-templates.md` own prompt construction and identity/scale locks.

Core visual rules:
- Sheet 01 is the identity/scale anchor when a sheet workflow is needed;
- Sheet 02+ exists only for real information overflow;
- every panel must reduce Geometry, Texture, or Animation ambiguity;
- content decides layout, not the reverse;
- later sheets elaborate rather than redesign;
- corrections use CHANGE + PRESERVE against approved authority.

A generated visual becomes approved visual authority only after explicit user acceptance when visual approval is material.

## Particle/VFX branch

Delegate to `.agents/skills/lazydesigner-particle-reference-authoring/SKILL.md` and `docs/02-reference/particle/README.md`.

Do not preload visual-reference modules for particle-only work. A new image reference is optional evidence, never a mandatory particle prerequisite.

Particle first-pass authoring may stop at validated `.particle.json` + required texture assets for review. A manifest, README, ZIP, or `REFERENCE.json` is delivery output and is not created merely because authoring completed.

## Package gate

Package generation requires one of:
- the user explicitly requests a package/handoff; or
- package delivery is already unambiguous in the current instruction.

Otherwise stop at the branch-specific reviewed artifact.

### Visual/model package

Use canonical owners under `docs/02-reference/package/`. Include only required files such as `REFERENCE.json`, `GEOMETRY.md`, optional `TEXTURE.md`, optional `ANIMATION.md`, and approved/supporting images.

### Particle/VFX package

Follow `docs/02-reference/particle/delivery.md`. Standalone user delivery is an ordinary Bedrock Resource Pack folder/ZIP. Add the canonical particle `REFERENCE.json` only for explicit LazyDesigner/Codex/MCP downstream handoff.

Do not export conversation transcript, compiled prompt history, scratch QA, duplicate bootstrap files, or unrelated reference branches.

## Unknown / readiness rule

Unknowns stay explicit. Readiness is stage-specific:

```text
READY
NOT_REQUIRED
NEEDS_REVIEW
BLOCKED
```

Missing information in one branch must not block an independent branch unless it changes that branch's actual decision.

## Completion

Reference Preparation is complete when:
- blocking information for the selected branch is resolved;
- any branch-specific required confirmation is explicit;
- only required reference capabilities were used;
- branch-specific QA is complete at the available proof ceiling;
- any requested package passes its consistency contract;
- no unsupported fact was invented.

Then stop. Downstream implementation belongs to Codex/LazyDesigner authoring Skills.
