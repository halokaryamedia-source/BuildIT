# Blockbench Bedrock Modelling

User-authorized autonomy replaces approval waits with verified checkpoints; never claim user approval.

## Minimum Necessary Evidence
- **No per-Cube inspection ceremony** without a diagnosed problem.
- **No screenshot-per-mutation loop.** Build a judgeable form, then gate it.
- `inspect_model_bounds` only for material envelope/scale/ground/displacement or bounded surface/contact questions; reuse fresh evidence.
- `UNVERIFIED` is not a retry command; request only decision-changing evidence.

## Reference Grounding
For reference-driven visual work, the **actual approved reference image** must be in **active multimodal context**; path/prose/memory is not visual evidence. Unavailable → `BLOCKED`. Bounded nonvisual edits use explicit intent and current authored state.
approved image owns visuals; dimensions own numeric scale; Geometry uses the native BlockIT Group/Cube authoring path.
Do not silently change agreed dimensions to improve resemblance. Resolve a material proportion/scale conflict with the user before dependent construction.
Evidence: `SUPPORTED | PROVISIONAL | CONFLICTING | UNAVAILABLE`. View Pair Map only for material front/back, depth, attachment, or 3/4 ambiguity.

### Reference Evidence Contract
Before the first primary Geometry batch, resolve only the structure that can materially change construction:
```text
identity-bearing silhouette
primary mass inventory + required visible part count
attachment/topology graph: parent → contact target → continuity expectation
cross-view width/height/depth evidence for each primary mass
intentional negative spaces/openings and required closed boundaries
asymmetry/orientation that changes construction
identity landmarks that require Geometry rather than Texture
motion participation: rigid | articulated | nonparticipating
pivot/contact/clearance requirement when Animation Required = YES
```
Each item is `SUPPORTED | PROVISIONAL | CONFLICTING | UNAVAILABLE`. `PROVISIONAL` may guide a reversible primary mass only when it cannot change part count, topology, articulation, or identity-critical silhouette. `CONFLICTING` or `UNAVAILABLE` on any such material item → `BLOCKED` before dependent construction.

**Coverage rule:** a visible required part may not disappear merely because one canonical view hides it. Build a primary-part checklist from the approved reference set and account for every required part as `GEOMETRY | TEXTURE | ANIMATION | OMIT(with reason)`. No silent omission, duplicate substitute, filler mass, or unsupported hidden structure.

**Depth rule:** front agreement never closes a mass whose depth remains material. For each primary mass, record depth as `OBSERVED | INFERRED | UNRESOLVED` and identify the view that constrains it. `UNRESOLVED` depth that changes silhouette, attachment, collision/contact, or motion clearance blocks dependent construction.

## Geometry Hot Path
`reference evidence contract → semantic form → representation choice → primary batch → Core View Triad → conditional surface integrity → causal correction → Geometry PASS → UV preflight → user review`.

Nontrivial form: **transient Primary Mass Contract**:
```text
mass / evidence views / must-exist reason
cross-view proportions / identity landmarks / surface-only detail reserved for Texture
parent/contact + symmetry/asymmetry
transform owner/pivot + negative-space boundary + representation
```
No per-Cube plan. New whole-form blockout defaults to Core View Triad `front + left + top`; bounded edits use affected views. Add `back` for rear topology/asymmetry; use `front_left_3q` for ambiguity or source-matched fidelity. Never recapture all five routinely.
Repeated/symmetric cohorts: derive once → one coherent `manage_cubes` batch; no per-Cube loop.

## Semantic Form / Construction / Transform Gate
Before exact coordinates determine:
```text
primary masses + must-exist reason
required count / symmetry or deliberate asymmetry
topology: what attaches to what
required continuous surfaces + intentional negative spaces
representation: geometry | texture | animation | omit
transform ownership + required attachment / contact target/invariant
evidence state
```
`SOLID_CUBOID | PLANE_LIKE | PLANAR_CUTOUT_CARRIER | LAYERED_SURFACE | SEGMENTED_FORM | TEXTURE | OMIT`.

A semantic label never authorizes coordinates. **No orphan/filler Cube**; `PROVISIONAL` placement never verifies it. Construction forms are **not presets**. Use texture for surface information.
Shared orientation/attachment/articulation → **Group/Bone-owned**; local rigid orientation may be Cube-owned. Primary mass: `AXIS_ALIGNED | ROTATED | UNRESOLVED`. Visible slope → pivot role `MASS_CENTER | ATTACHMENT | JOINT | PARENT_TRANSFORM`; attachment/joint pivot owns shared transform. Material `UNRESOLVED` → `BLOCKED`. AABB overlap, hierarchy, or numeric touching is not contact proof.
When `Animation Required = YES`, leave **motion-ready structure**: cohorts, pivots, clearance, contact invariants. A known rig/contact defect does not wait for Animation.

## Production-Scale Entity Construction
Large counts, rotated Cubes, per-face UV and Locators can be valid. Locator = lightweight attachment/effect anchor. Visible Bounds = native culling/export metadata; check animation extremes.

## Primary Mass / Proportion / Depth
Coordinates follow one coherent volume interpretation. Derive adjoining masses from shared boundaries; judge landmark size/spacing against the whole form before secondary detail.
`frame/envelope → primary masses → shared boundaries → cross-view proportions → depth/layering → silhouette/proportion gate → primary blockout`.
Front/back constrain width+height; sides depth+height; top width+depth. **Front agreement does not certify depth.** Depth: `OBSERVED | INFERRED | UNRESOLVED`. Minor drift → one interpretation. Do not average drift. Only unresolved material conflict becomes `BLOCKED`.

## Surface Coverage / Negative Space
**do not force universal watertight geometry**; designed openings remain open.
Relations: `CLOSED_BOUNDARY | INTENTIONAL_OPENING | LAYERED_OFFSET | INTENTIONAL_INTERSECTION | CUTOUT_CARRIER`.
For adjacency/layer/contact use fresh views + one bounded `inspect_model_bounds`. Each required surface class needs current evidence once. Review `z_fighting | micro_gap | coplanar_edge_gap | shallow_penetration`; overlap alone never proves correctness.

## Geometry Detail Budget
Decide representation **before** counting Cubes.
`GEOMETRY` → 3D silhouette/volume/opening/contact/negative-space boundary/layering/motion.
`TEXTURE` → surface pattern/color/seam/panel line/marking.
`OMIT` → unsupported/immaterial.

Detail-only span/thickness `<= 4 Blockbench units` is an **anti-overcube guardrail, not a classifier**. Challenge 3D need. `PLANAR_CUTOUT_CARRIER`: 1 plane or 2 crossed planes (~90°) in one batch carries alpha silhouette instead of micro-Cubes. One zero-span axis may be plane-like Geometry; 2+ collapsed axes are unusable.

## Primary Build / Difference-First Reference Fidelity Verdict
`requirement → source evidence → simplest recognizable Blockbench-buildable interpretation → PRIMARY BLOCKOUT + required hierarchy/pivots → primary PASS → identity-weighted secondary geometry`.

Verdict requires approved reference + fresh current-revision model evidence:
`claim | matching reference view | current view | observed difference | severity | owning cause | FAIL | UNVERIFIED | PASS`.
Mutation stales affected captures. Correct first cause, then recapture affected views. `capture_model_views` correspondence metadata only maps captures to canonical board slots; it is not a scorer and never creates visual PASS.
Tool success, coordinates, bounds, hierarchy, validators, or similarity scores cannot justify `PASS`. Internal Geometry `PASS` requires form/depth, surface integrity, hierarchy/pivots, and no major defect.

**Largest-difference-first:** rank only material visible differences by construction consequence, not pixel area. Fix in this order when applicable: missing/extra required part → wrong topology/attachment → wrong primary silhouette/proportion/depth → broken negative space/contact → pivot/motion-readiness defect → secondary geometric detail. Do not spend a correction round polishing a smaller difference while a higher-order structural defect remains.

**Cross-view regression rule:** a correction is accepted only when the intended difference improves and no required orthographic relation materially regresses. A front-view improvement that breaks side depth, rear attachment, top footprint, or motion clearance is `REGRESSED`, not progress.

Before user review, state the largest remaining reference differences at comparable angle/scale, including depth and identity landmarks. Neutral contact alone cannot certify an articulated assembly: inspect required closed boundaries in representative extremes, especially jaw/cheek/chest and limb attachments when present. Correct the owning structure before detail or production keys; do not hide unresolved gaps behind texture or filler Cubes.

**UV Readiness Preflight** checks thin/Box-UV collapse, aspect/representation, seam/unique-region blockers. Read-only: no production UV/`UV Layout PASS`. **User Geometry APPROVED is required** before production UV.
Layered contacts and exposed undersides need an affected side/bottom view when front/three-quarter views conceal the boundary. Distinguish dark material from actual missing surface; a prior approval does not clear a newly observed major defect.

## Native UV Layout / Texel Integrity
`Geometry APPROVED → create_texture(type=template), explicit pixel_density, rearrange_uv=true, power_of_two=true → native UV/template → audit → UV Layout PASS → Texturing`.

No guessed/stretched islands. Prefer per-face UV; use minimum proven native power-of-two packing. Audit padding/aspect/orientation/overlap/reuse/asymmetry. `uv_audit.production_gate=ready` is hygiene, not UV Layout PASS. Requested atlas size and density are constraints. Do not silently enlarge the atlas.
Review the actual atlas and mapped adjoining surfaces together: group islands by editable semantic cohorts, allocate detail to identity-critical regions, and explain intentional mirroring or seams. Record technical validity separately from this layout verdict. Fractional logical UV can be valid when physical pixel mapping is integral; never resize approved Geometry solely to obtain integer logical coordinates.
Native packing is a starting layout. Keep named body/head/appendage cohorts in readable zones with coherent order and gutters. Reposition exact native islands via UV offsets without stretching; verify bounds/overlap. Scattered placement fails editability even if the audit is ready. Unused atlas stays transparent.

## Local Correction / Convergence
`TRANSLATE placement | RESIZE extent | ROTATE orientation | REATTACH contact/parent | LAYER OFFSET surface separation/inset | SPLIT distinct volume/orientation | MERGE/REMOVE compensatory geometry | ADD MASS missing volume`.

`LAYER OFFSET` uses translate/resize or justified inflate/deflate; never a universal epsilon. Hidden intersection may be intentional; exposed coplanar overlap/hairline gaps are not.
Reuse fresh exact authored state; otherwise `inspect_elements(mode=detail)` once. State target UUID(s), cause, intended change, invariant; returned `geometry_effect` must match intent.
`REMOVE`/`REATTACH` preserve the whole assembly boundary and intentional openings. For `RESIZE` on mapped/textured Geometry, preflight UV/pixel impact and choose `PRESERVE_MAPPING | PRESERVE_DENSITY | RELAYOUT`.
Reuse fresh affected pre-correction evidence; capture before mutation only when none exists. After mutation, recapture affected view(s); expand only for cross-view regression risk. `IMPROVED | UNCHANGED | REGRESSED`; require `IMPROVED` without regression elsewhere. Same causal correction failing twice without new evidence → `BLOCKED`.

## Existing Assets / Shared Session
Existing geometry is a baseline, not fidelity proof. Geometry owns shape/rig/UV; Texturing pixels/PBR. Geometry↔Texturing stays shared AUTHORING; `HANDOFF_REQUIRED` + `switch_authoring_phase` only for AUTHORING↔Animation.
