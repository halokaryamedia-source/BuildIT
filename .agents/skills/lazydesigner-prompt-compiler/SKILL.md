# LazyDesigner Prompt Compiler

This Skill runs only inside ChatGPT-side Reference Preparation. Its purpose is to prevent weak, fragmented, casual, typo-heavy, or contaminated conversation context from becoming the direct generation prompt.

## Core Rule

```text
RAW USER INPUT
+ CONFIRMED ANSWERS
+ APPROVED PRIOR DECISIONS
→ CLEAN PRODUCTION BRIEF
```

The compiled brief is an execution representation of user intent, not a new creative authority.

## Hard Boundary

The compiler may:
- normalize wording;
- deduplicate repeated instructions;
- resolve pronouns/references from confirmed context;
- convert casual language into concise technical language;
- preserve explicit constraints;
- separate required vs optional details;
- preserve approved reference identity;
- express unresolved information as UNKNOWN.

The compiler must not:
- invent dimensions;
- invent materials, colors, parts, motion, anatomy, topology, style, or hidden structure;
- silently choose among unresolved alternatives;
- change user intent;
- override approved images;
- convert a guess into a requirement.

## Input Gate

Do not compile a production brief while a blocking requirement is unresolved.

Blocking information is anything that can materially change the generated target, such as:
- what the asset fundamentally is;
- the major subtype when needed for identity;
- a required style/reference direction when multiple materially different outcomes remain possible;
- dimensions when scale is required for the requested handoff;
- animation YES/NO when it changes reference preparation;
- critical attachment, orientation, part-count, or action information;
- any explicit user-specific requirement that is still ambiguous.

When blocking information is missing, return `NEEDS_USER_INPUT` with only simple user-facing questions.

## Question Style

Questions must be easy to answer without technical knowledge.

Prefer:
- short multiple-choice wording when useful;
- familiar object terms;
- one concise batch of the fewest decision-changing questions.

Avoid asking users for topology, pivot matrices, UV strategy, deformation terminology, or other implementation language.

Example:

```text
Instead of:
"Define articulation topology and pivot ownership."

Ask:
"Bagian mana yang perlu bergerak? Misalnya tangan, pintu, roda, atau tidak ada."
```

## Compiled Brief Contract

The internal brief should contain only confirmed or evidence-backed information:

```text
ASSET
PROFILE
GOAL
VISUAL TARGET
REQUIRED FEATURES
DIMENSIONS
ANIMATION REQUIREMENT
REFERENCE AUTHORITY
STRUCTURAL PRIORITIES
MATERIAL PRIORITIES
MOTION PRIORITIES
PRESERVE
UNKNOWN / NON-BLOCKING
```

Omit empty sections when they do not help execution.

## Context Hygiene

Do not pass the entire raw conversation as the generation prompt when a compiled brief can represent the current approved state.

For corrections, compile a delta:

```text
CHANGE
PRESERVE
AFFECTED REFERENCE MODULES
NEW BLOCKERS
```

Old rejected directions must not remain active merely because they occurred earlier in chat.

## Final Confirmation Input

When all blocking information is resolved, produce a short `CONFIRMATION_SUMMARY` for the Reference Preparation Skill.

It should answer only:
- what will be made;
- the main visual/structural direction;
- whether animation/reference extras are included when relevant.

Example:

```text
Akan dibuat NPC miner bergaya Minecraft Bedrock HD, tinggi 2 blok, memakai tool referensi yang Anda kirim, dan disiapkan untuk animasi dengan perhatian pada sendi bahu, pinggul, dan lutut.
```

Do not generate images, JSON, Markdown package files, or other artifacts from this Skill.

## Completion

Return one of:

```text
NEEDS_USER_INPUT
READY_FOR_CONFIRMATION
```

`READY_FOR_CONFIRMATION` means the brief is internally clean and no generation-blocking requirement remains. Actual generation is still forbidden until the user explicitly confirms the final summary.
