# LazyDesigner MCP Gateway

LazyDesigner Gateway is the stable four-tool MCP client boundary in front of the volatile Blockbench Runtime. LazyDesigner Control provides intake/context/readiness/routing through this boundary; Gateway itself does not become a second workflow engine.

```text
AI client / Codex
   ↓ stable stdio session
LazyDesigner Gateway
   ↓ reconnectable loopback Streamable HTTP session
LazyDesigner Runtime inside Blockbench
```

The Gateway is the persistence boundary: Runtime/plugin reload, rebuild, phase change, temporary Runtime loss, or Blockbench restart must not require restarting the AI client. Runtime transport objects and capability catalogs are disposable and may be rebuilt behind the same Gateway process. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the persistent connection design.

## Stable Client Surface

```text
status
search_capabilities
describe_capability
invoke_capability
```

Blockbench/plugin reload and Runtime stage changes do not change the client-facing Gateway tool surface.

## Control Bootstrap

When orientation is unknown or materially stale:

```text
status
→ control.task_context_id
→ control.readiness
→ control.stage_context
→ control.context
→ control.blockers
```

Asset authoring may provide:

```text
reference_package_path
workspace_path
current_user_delta
known_context_ids
```

Control consumes compact `REFERENCE.json` + Active Workspace state and projects only the active authoring context:

```text
GEOMETRY_CONTEXT
TEXTURE_CONTEXT
ANIMATION_CONTEXT
```

Geometry receives the Modelling Skill plus exactly one selected profile when available. Texturing and Animation do not reload the full modelling profile by default.

For LazyDesigner source/product development:

```text
status(task_mode=SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT, task_intent=<concrete problem>)
```

returns bounded source/specialist/test ownership without loading asset reference/workspace context.

## Capability Discovery

Known capability → invoke directly. Search is fallback for unknown/stale names; describe is fallback for real schema uncertainty.

```text
PRIMARY      normal authoring hot path
SUPPORT      valid conditional capability
EXPERIMENTAL explicit matching intent only
MAINTENANCE  legacy/debug fallback
```

`search_capabilities` defaults to at most four results. Search results carry Control domain/source-owner metadata but not duplicate full schemas.

Canonical capability phase classification is owned by:

```text
mcp/lib/authoringPhase.ts
```

Control does not maintain a second Geometry/Texturing/Animation capability table.

## Project / Tab Affinity

One Gateway process retains only:

```text
project UUID affinity
+ authoring phase affinity
```

It does not cache model objects, selections, textures, animations, Undo state, or other authored project data.

Project binding remains conservative:

```text
0 open projects → no binding
1 open project  → first project-sensitive invocation binds that UUID
2+ projects     → select intended tab and call status(adopt_active_project=true) once
```

Bound-project loss fails closed with `PROJECT_CONTEXT_LOST`.

## Authoring / Animation Handoff

Geometry↔Texturing stays on the shared AUTHORING Runtime surface. Semantic ownership changes without client/runtime phase bounce.

`switch_authoring_phase` is reserved for AUTHORING↔Animation:

```text
invoke through Gateway
→ phase affinity changes
→ backend Runtime catalog invalidates
→ next request reconnects/refetches requested Runtime surface
→ same AI task/chat continues
```

No manual AI-client reconnect is required.

## Persistent Runtime Recovery

The Gateway process remains alive when Runtime disappears or is replaced. Recovery is demand-driven rather than heartbeat-driven:

```text
explicit Gateway request
→ health probe
→ compare Runtime signature
→ reuse current backend when unchanged
→ otherwise drop only backend transport/catalog
→ reconnect to current Runtime
→ refresh catalog once
→ continue the same Codex task
```

Repeated Runtime failures use bounded exponential backoff. There is no background reconnect loop, idle heartbeat chatter, or automatic mutation replay.

Expected behavior:

```text
plugin reload       → backend reconnect only
Runtime rebuild     → backend reconnect only
phase handoff       → catalog refresh on next request
Blockbench closed   → Gateway stays alive/offline
Blockbench reopened → next explicit request reconnects automatically
Codex               → remains connected throughout
```

## Control Delta

Every normal invocation receives a compact post-operation `control_delta`.

```text
ordinary mutation
→ affected knowledge marked stale
→ no automatic full status reread

phase/project authority change
→ requires_status_refresh=true
```

Dependency direction currently distinguishes:

```text
Geometry → Geometry + potentially dependent Texture/Animation
Texture  → Texture + potentially dependent Animation
Animation→ Animation
```

This is affected-knowledge metadata, not a forced full downstream reset.

## Context / Result Economy

Context handles use SHA-256 identities of current canonical repository files. `known_context_ids` suppresses unchanged Skill/profile content and invalidates changed members of the same family.

The former asset-router Skill is not mandatory authoring context.

The Runtime remains complete native/debug evidence owner. Gateway may compact normal continuation receipts when omitted data is redundant, while preserving failure/uncertainty evidence needed for recovery.

No heartbeat chatter, background catalog polling, automatic confirmation reads, or automatic mutation retries are introduced.

## Reliability Invariants

- Gateway startup does not require Blockbench to be open.
- Blockbench/plugin reload does not terminate the Gateway process.
- Changed Runtime build/profile/stage invalidates cached backend catalog.
- Backend reconnect is automatic on the next explicit request; the AI client stays connected.
- Repeated unavailable backends are rate-limited by bounded reconnect backoff.
- Each Gateway owns one project UUID affinity and one authoring-phase affinity.
- Cross-Gateway Runtime calls remain serialized around Blockbench process-wide project globals.
- Bound project loss fails closed.
- Runtime calls and queue depth are bounded.
- `tools/call` is never automatically retried after transport interruption/timeout.
- Interrupted mutation may return `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`; inspect state before retrying.
- Gateway owns no authored model state or persistent Control database.
- Gateway connects only to loopback Runtime URLs.

## Run Locally

From `mcp/`:

```bash
bun run gateway
```

Runtime endpoint default:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/bb-mcp
```

Internal package/server identifiers may still contain legacy `blockit-*` names during migration. Do not treat them as a second product.

## Current Source Surface

```text
Gateway client tools      4
Runtime callable union   54
AUTHORING surface        47
Animation surface        20
```

These are source-era counts, not installed Runtime proof.

Current proof interpretation:

```text
../../docs/05-operations/current-validation.md
```

## Proof Boundary

Source/static contracts can establish Gateway/Control structure, context selection, bounded routing, affinity/retry semantics and invalidation intent. They do not prove installed Runtime freshness, native Blockbench behavior, visual fidelity, persistence/playback, or measured end-to-end usage reduction.
