## Install LazyDesigner Locally

LazyDesigner must be validated from this repository's **`Local` branch**. Do **not** use an upstream hosted Blockbench MCP plugin as proof of LazyDesigner; it is a different product/artifact surface.

Build the local plugin from `mcp/`:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run build
bun run docs:check
```

Load the generated compatibility bundle in desktop Blockbench:

```text
mcp/dist/blockit_mcp.js
```

`blockit_mcp.js` is a retained compatibility filename, not the current product name.

Default MCP endpoint after the plugin is running:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/bb-mcp
```

Keep **Legacy UI Fallbacks (Debug)** disabled for normal Bedrock Entity authoring. `risky_eval` and `from_geo_json` remain disabled.

For the current repository acceptance procedure, follow root `docs/05-operations/next-action.md` and `docs/05-operations/local-acceptance-runbook.md`. This install fragment only owns local build/load guidance; it does not replace repository task routing.
