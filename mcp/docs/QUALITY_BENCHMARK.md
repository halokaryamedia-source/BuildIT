# BlockIT Authoring Quality Benchmark

This is an evaluation contract for comparing authoring quality and efficiency across representative asset classes. It is **not** a new Runtime tool, authoring workflow, score engine, or acceptance authority.

Canonical machine-readable cases live in `mcp/tests/fixtures/quality-benchmark-cases.json`.

## Purpose

Use the same evidence vocabulary across Geometry, Texturing, and Animation so improvements can be judged against accepted output rather than proxy metrics.

```text
approved reference + explicit dimensions/constraints
→ authored result
→ comparable visual/runtime evidence
→ PASS | FAIL | UNVERIFIED per applicable dimension
→ causal correction
→ accepted result
→ measure authoring cost separately
```

There is no aggregate quality score. A critical visual/structural failure cannot be averaged away by good results elsewhere, and fewer tool calls cannot compensate for lower quality.

## Representative Profiles

The benchmark set intentionally spans four materially different construction problems:

1. `PROP_FURNITURE` — rigid structure, attachment/contact, negative space, material identity.
2. `VEHICLE` — multi-part rigid structure, depth, repeated/mechanical forms, optional articulation.
3. `CHARACTER_MOB` — articulated hierarchy, joint closure, deformation readability, pose/motion fidelity.
4. `ORGANIC_CURVED` — non-boxy silhouette, segmentation quality, depth continuity, curve interpretation.

These are evaluation profiles, not geometry presets. They must not force a modelling method or cube count.

## Evidence Authority

For reference-driven work:

```text
explicit user facts / dimensions
→ approved reference image(s)
→ current authored state
→ fresh comparable capture / texture / playback evidence
```

Paths, memory, tool success, coordinates, bounds, hierarchy, cube count, keyframe count, or a generated similarity number are not visual proof by themselves.

A dimension is:

- `PASS` only when current evidence supports it and no material defect remains;
- `FAIL` when current evidence shows a material defect;
- `UNVERIFIED` when the required evidence is absent, stale, obstructed, or technically unavailable.

`UNVERIFIED` is not failure and is not permission to invent a result.

## Geometry Dimensions

Every profile checks at least:

- silhouette;
- cross-view proportion;
- required part completeness;
- attachment/contact;
- depth/layering;
- intentional negative space.

Profile-specific dimensions extend this list. Examples include motion-ready structure and curve segmentation quality.

Critical geometry defects include missing/floating required parts, wrong required part count, broken attachment, and reference-unsupported invented structure. These remain `FAIL` regardless of technical validator success.

## Texture Dimensions

When Texturing applies, evaluate:

- palette/material-region correspondence;
- identity-critical markings;
- mapped-surface continuity;
- seam control.

Texture cannot hide a required Geometry defect. Dark pixels, shading, or alpha are not substitutes for missing required surfaces unless the approved representation explicitly calls for a planar/cutout carrier.

## Animation Dimensions

When Animation applies, evaluate only relevant motion requirements. The Character/Mob case explicitly checks:

- pivot/rig suitability;
- reference-pose fidelity;
- joint-gap control;
- clearance/contact;
- weight transfer;
- timing/motion readability;
- loop or handoff continuity.

Excessive joint gaps, invalid pivots, unintended foot slide, floor penetration, or broken required contact are critical defects. Animation uses categorical evidence verdicts, not a numeric quality score.

## Difference-First Review

Review the largest identity-bearing difference first:

```text
reference requirement
→ matching reference view/time
→ current model view/time
→ observed difference
→ owning phase/cause
→ smallest coherent correction
→ recapture only affected evidence
```

Do not correct downstream styling when the first wrong owner is Geometry or rig structure. Do not add filler cubes or extra keyframes merely to improve a proxy count.

## Efficiency Measurement

Measure efficiency only after or alongside quality evidence. Record:

- status calls;
- capability-search calls;
- capability-describe calls;
- redundant readbacks;
- visual capture batches;
- correction rounds;
- repeated same-cause failures;
- total tool calls to accepted result.

The target is **Cost to Accepted Result**, not minimum tool calls in isolation.

## Future Local Benchmark Run

When local testing is authorized, run all four profiles with fixed reference/constraint inputs and retain:

```text
input reference revision
model artifact revision
phase verdicts
critical defects
correction history
accepted/not accepted
usage/tool-call observations
runtime/environment notes
```

Compare implementation changes only against equivalent inputs and acceptance criteria. A prepared fixture or passing static test is not live visual/runtime proof.
