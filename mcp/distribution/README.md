# BlockIT Managed Distribution

The managed distribution installs a verified BlockIT Gateway executable, Blockbench plugin bundle, canonical authoring Skills/instructions, foundation references, workspace conventions, license/notices, and the BlockIT portion of Codex MCP configuration.

It does not own user assets and does not create model history.

## Managed layout

```text

├─ plugin/blockit_mcp.js
├─ installed.json
├─ pending.json              # only when activation is deferred
└─ transactions/

Authoring workspace

└─ workspace/README.md
```

User assets remain under `workspace/active` or user-owned locations and never become application rollback payload.

## Source / Runtime authority

The package is built from one exact source SHA and records file hashes plus Runtime `build_identity`. Normal Codex launch points at the versioned Gateway executable; Blockbench loads the managed `blockit_mcp.js`.

BlockIT now has one native Geometry authoring path. Retired 3D-assisted/Hunyuan/PrimitiveAnything tooling is not part of the managed package or authoring contract.

## Safe activation and recovery

Updates are explicit, not network polling during authoring. The package is downloaded/built and verified before activation. Active Gateway process leases or a responding Runtime postpone replacement. A pending update may activate only when no conflicting Gateway/Runtime is active.

The manager never kills applications, closes unsaved models, silently overwrites user-edited managed Skills, or mutates user assets. Transaction journals and hashes protect install/update/rollback. Local modifications require explicit adoption where supported.

## Codex configuration

Only the BlockIT MCP entry is managed. Other servers, model/settings semantics, comments, timeouts, disabled/remote entries, and unrelated configuration remain preserved or fail closed when safe preservation cannot be proven.

Normal MCP launch uses the installed versioned Gateway executable directly. The maintenance command wrapper exists for explicit install/update/status/recovery operations; it is not the normal authoring transport.

## Package verification

A valid package must match repository identity, source SHA, build identity, platform, required file inventory, byte sizes and SHA-256 hashes. Path traversal, linked destination components, incomplete payloads, duplicate entries and stale concurrent writes fail closed.

Generated/runtime/static verification does not establish live Blockbench visual or native authoring acceptance.
